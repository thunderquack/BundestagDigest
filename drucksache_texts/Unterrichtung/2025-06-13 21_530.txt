Bulgarien beabsichtigt, der dritten Stufe der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion 
zum 1. Januar 2026 beizutreten. Die am 4. Juni 2025 veröffentlichten
Konvergenzberichte der Europäischen Kommission (Anlage 2) und der Europäischen 
Zentralbank (Anlage 3) kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass Bulgarien die
Voraussetzungen für den Beitritt zum Euroraum, die sogenannten Konvergenzkriterien,
erfüllt. Ebenfalls am 4. Juni 2025 hat die Europäische Kommission einen Vorschlag 
für einen Beschluss des Rates vorgelegt, der das bulgarische Beitrittsersuchen
befürwortet und die Ausnahmeregelung des Artikels 139 des Vertrags über die
Arbeitsweise der Europäischen Union (AEUV) für Bulgarien aufhebt sowie – darauf 
Die an den Deutschen Bundestag übermittelte Ursprungsdatei ermöglichte keine Weiterverarbeitung zu einer 
barrierefreien Bundestagsdrucksache.
aufbauend – einen Vorschlag zur rechtlichen Umsetzung der Einführung des Euro 
in Bulgarien. 
Die Berichte der Europäischen Kommission und der Europäischen Zentralbank 
würdigen die Anstrengungen Bulgariens, die Konvergenzkriterien für den
Eurobeitritt zu erfüllen. Im Einzelnen attestieren die Berichte, dass die rechtliche
Konvergenz gegeben ist, die Inflationsrate sowie der langfristige Zinssatz in der
Referenzperiode unterhalb der Referenzwerte liegen, die Tragfähigkeit der
öffentlichen Finanzen erreicht wird sowie die Wechselkursstabilität gegenüber dem Euro 
besteht. 
Die Bundesregierung teilt die Gesamteinschätzung der Konvergenzberichte und 
beabsichtigt, dem Beschlussvorschlag der Europäischen Kommission zum Beitritt 
Bulgariens zum Euroraum zuzustimmen. 
Auf europäischer Ebene ist für das weitere Verfahren ein enger Zeitplan
vorgesehen. Nach der politischen Beratung des Rates für Wirtschaft und Finanzen (ECO-
FIN-Rat) am 19./20. Juni 2025 zum Euroraumbeitritt Bulgariens sind
entsprechend Artikel 140 Absatz 2 AEUV als weitere Schritte vorgesehen: die
Aussprache im Europäischen Rat am 26./27. Juni 2025, die Anhörung des Europäischen 
Parlaments am 8. Juli 2025 und die abschließende Entscheidung des ECOFIN- 
Rates am 8. Juli 2025. 
Das Gesetz über die Zusammenarbeit von Bundesregierung und Deutschem
Bundestag in Angelegenheiten der Europäischen Union (EUZBBG) sieht in § 9a ein 
besonderes parlamentarisches Beteiligungsverfahren für Fälle der Einführung des 
Euro in einem Mitgliedstaat vor. Vor der abschließenden Entscheidung im Rat 
sollen der Deutsche Bundestag und die Bundesregierung das Einvernehmen
herstellen. Ich weise den Deutschen Bundestag in diesem Zusammenhang
vorsorglich ausdrücklich auf sein verfassungsrechtliches Recht zur Stellungnahme hin. 
Im Hinblick auf den dargestellten engen zeitlichen Beratungsverlauf auf
europäischer Ebene bitte ich den Deutschen Bundestag von seinem Recht zur
Stellungnahme so frühzeitig wie möglich Gebrauch zu machen, damit die
Bundesregierung rechtzeitig – wenn möglich bereits in der Aussprache im Europäischen Rat 
am 26./27. Juni 2025 – diese Haltung zum Beitrittsgesuch Bulgariens
berücksichtigen kann. Die klare Positionierung Deutschlands zur Erweiterung der Eurozone, 
wenn alle Voraussetzungen für den Beitritt erfüllt sind, ist ein wichtiges Signal 
sowohl gegenüber Bulgarien als auch für die Eurozone insgesamt. Die
Stellungnahme des Bundestages wird spätestens für die Positionierung der
Bundesregierung zum ECOFIN am 8. Juli 2025 benötigt. 
Mit Blick auf das Ziel, Einvernehmen mit dem Deutschen Bundestag herzustellen, 
stehe ich jederzeit für eine weitergehende Unterrichtung und Aussprache zur
Verfügung. Zur besseren Übersicht übersende ich Ihnen mit diesem Schreiben fünf 
Anlagen und verweise insbesondere auf Anlage 1, in der die Erfüllung der
Konvergenzkriterien durch Bulgarien zusammenfassend dargestellt ist. 
Die Bundesregierung wird im Rahmen ihrer fortlaufenden Unterrichtung über den 
Rat Wirtschaft und Finanzen kontinuierlich über die weitere Entwicklung der
Vorgänge informieren.
Anlage 1 
Wesentliche Ergebnisse der Konvergenzberichte der Europäischen Kommission und der 
Europäischen Zentralbank zur Erfüllung der Konvergenzkriterien durch Bulgarien 
Am 4. Juni 2025 veröffentlichten Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) und Europäischen Kommission (KOM) ihre 
Konvergenzberichte, die auf Ersuchen der bulgarischen Regierung erstellt wurden. In den Konvergenzberichten 
wird dargestellt, inwieweit die EU-Mitgliedstaaten außerhalb des Euroraums die Bedingungen für den Beitritt 
zum Euroraum erfüllen und welche Fortschritte sie beim Konvergenzprozess erreicht haben. Bulgarien erfüllt 
nach Einschätzung der KOM und der EZB sämtliche Konvergenzkriterien, bestehend aus rechtlicher Konvergenz 
und vier wirtschaftlichen Kriterien (Preisstabilität, tragfähige öffentliche Finanzlage, Wechselkursstabilität
gegenüber dem Euro und langfristiger Zinssatz). 
Rechtliche Konvergenz: 
KOM und EZB stimmen überein, dass die bulgarischen Rechtsvorschriften im monetären Bereich mit EU-Recht 
konform sind. Dazu zählen vor allem die Unabhängigkeit der Zentralbank, das Verbot monetärer
Staatsfinanzierung und die rechtliche Integration der bulgarischen Nationalbank (BNB) in das Europäische System der
Zentralbanken und der EZB. Die Satzung und das Gesetz über die BNB sind vollständig mit den Art. 130 und 131 des 
AEUV vereinbar. 
Preisstabilität: 
Das Kriterium ist erfüllt. Für den zwölfmonatigen Referenzzeitraum (Mai 2024 bis April 2025) weist Bulgarien 
eine durchschnittliche Inflationsrate von 2,7 Prozent aus. Sie liegt damit knapp unter dem Referenzwert von 
2,8 Prozent. Der Referenzwert wurde berechnet, indem zum ungewichteten arithmetischen Mittel der im
Referenzzeitraum gemessenen Inflationsraten von Irland (1,2 Prozent), Finnland (1,3 Prozent) und Italien (1,4
Prozent) 1,5 Prozentpunkte addiert wurden. 
Tragfähige öffentliche Finanzlage: 
Das Kriterium ist erfüllt, da zum Zeitpunkt der Prüfung kein Beschluss des Rates nach Art. 126 Abs. 6 AEUV 
vorlag, wonach in Bulgarien ein übermäßiges Defizit besteht. 2024 lag das öffentliche Defizit bei 3 Prozent des 
BIP und entsprach somit dem Maastricht-Referenzwert. Für 2025 erwartet die KOM ein öffentliches Defizit von 
2,8 Prozent des BIP. Der öffentliche Schuldenstand lag 2024 bei 24,1 Prozent und soll laut KOM bis 2026 auf 
27,1 Prozent steigen, liegt aber trotzdem weit unter dem Maastricht-Referenzwertes von 60 Prozent. 
Wechselkursstabilität gegenüber dem Euro: 
Das Kriterium ist erfüllt, da Bulgarien die im Rahmen des Wechselkursmechanismus des Europäischen
Währungssystems vorgesehenen normalen Bandbreiten in den letzten zwei Jahren vor der Prüfung ohne starke
Spannungen eingehalten hat. Bulgarien nimmt seit Juli 2020 am WKM II teil. Der bulgarische Lew wurde in den 
WKM II zu einem Leitkurs von 1,9558 Lew pro Euro mit einer Standardschwankungsbreite von ±15 Prozent 
aufgenommen. In den letzten 5 Jahren wies der Lew keine Abweichung vom Leitkurs auf. 
Langfristiger Zinssatz: 
Das Kriterium ist erfüllt. Der durchschnittliche langfristige Nominalzinssatz in Bulgarien lag im
Referenzzeitraum (Mai 2024 bis April 2025) bei 3,9 Prozent und damit unterhalb des Referenzwertes für das Zinskriterium 
von 5,1 Prozent. Der Referenzwert wurde berechnet, indem zum Zwölfmonatsdurchschnitt der langfristigen 
Zinssätze Irlands (2,8 Prozent), Finnlands (2,9 Prozent) und Italiens (3,7 Prozent), die drei Länder, die auch in die 
Berechnung des Referenzwerts für das Preisstabilitätskriterium einbezogen wurden, 2 Prozentpunkte addiert
wurden.

1. PURPOSE OF THE REPORT
The euro is meant to be the single currency of the European Union as a whole. It is currently used every day 
by around 350 million people in the 20 Member States of the euro area. The practical benefits include more 
stable prices, lower transaction costs for people and businesses, more transparent and competitive markets 
and increased intra-EU and international trade. The euro is also the second most used currency worldwide. 
Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) requires the Commission and the 
European Central Bank (ECB) to report to the Council, at least once every two years, or at the request of a 
Member State with a derogation1, on the progress that Member States have made in fulfilling their 
obligations to achieve economic and monetary union. The latest Commission and ECB convergence reports 
were adopted in June 2024. 
The 2025 Convergence Report on Bulgaria has been prepared in response to a request for a convergence 
assessment from Bulgaria, submitted on 25 February 2025. The staff working document accompanying this 
report provides a more detailed assessment of the state of convergence in Bulgaria2. 
Article 140(1) TFEU requires the reports to include an examination of the compatibility of national legislation, 
including the statutes of national central banks, with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and the Statute of the 
European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (‘the ESCB/ECB Statute’). The reports 
must also examine whether a high degree of sustainable convergence has been achieved in the Member State 
concerned by means of: (i) referring to the fulfilment of the four convergence criteria (price stability, public 
finances, exchange rate stability and long-term interest rates); and (ii) taking account of other factors relevant 
to economic integration and convergence mentioned in the final subparagraph of Article 140(1) TFEU. The 
four convergence criteria are developed further in a protocol annexed to the Treaties (Protocol No 13 on the 
convergence criteria). 
The convergence assessment in this report is presented against the background of recent economic and policy 
developments. Following the EU’s weak economic performance in 2023, when GDP grew by 0.4%, the 
economy returned to moderate growth of 1.0% in 2024, with stronger momentum at the end of the year than 
previously expected. Private consumption was supported by continued growth in real wages and higher 
employment, with a remarkably strong labour market. After the peak in EU inflation in October 2022, which 
was driven by the surge in energy prices from around mid-2021 until the third quarter of 2022, a 
disinflationary process started towards the end of 2022. This process progressed in 2023 and throughout 
much of 2024, with EU headline inflation averaging 2.6% that year, and is expected to continue in 2025. 
Inflation divergence across the EU Member States also narrowed significantly in 2024. With the disinflation 
process well on track, in April 2025 the ECB cut its policy rate for the seventh time since June 2024, to 2.25%. 
The economic outlook, including the Commission’s 2025 Spring Economic Forecast for HICP inflation for the 
EU as a whole and for individual Member States, including Bulgaria, is characterised by an unusually high 
degree of uncertainty. In early 2025, the EU and global economies were hit by the most significant
policyinduced trade and economic uncertainty shock in decades. It is unclear what the landing zone for the US 
tariffs vis-à-vis trading partners would be, which forces the Commission forecast to rely on several technical 
assumptions3. Beyond trade, broader geopolitical tensions remain elevated, heightening risks, weighing on 
confidence, and posing significant risks to the economic outlook.  
In Bulgaria, economic growth accelerated from 1.9% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024, driven by private consumption, 
which was, in turn, sustained by higher real wages, employment gains and increased social benefits. Real GDP 
growth in Bulgaria is forecast to slow down again from 2.8% in 2024 to 2% in 2025. Annual average HICP 
inflation in Bulgaria slowed to 2.6% in 2024, while inflation developments in 2025 and in 2026 are set to be 
driven by several price hikes at the beginning of 2025 and, subsequently, by both external prices and 
domestic cost factors exerting downward pressure on inflation. 
1 The Member States that have not yet fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the euro are referred to as ’Member States with a 
derogation’. Denmark negotiated an opt-out before the Maastricht Treaty was adopted and does not participate in the third stage of 
economic and monetary union. 
2 The cut-off date for the data used in this report is 19 May 2025. The convergence assessment is based on a range of monthly 
convergence indicators that have been calculated up to April 2025.  
3 Significantly, the individualised ‘reciprocal’ higher tariffs are assumed to not be reinstated at the expiry of the 90 days suspension. 
The forecast also assumes that the exceptionally high tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed after April 2, will be scaled back to
preescalation levels, as they are deemed unsustainable. By the time the Commission forecast was published, on 19 May 2025, the new 
tariffs in place were lower than those assumed at the cut-off date.

The expected acceleration in implementing the recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) and the cohesion policy 
programmes can at least partly offset the negative consequences of the weaker international environment 
and play a crucial role in the convergence process of many non-euro area EU Member States. Besides 
contributing to higher growth and improved public finances in the near term, the Recovery and Resilience 
Facility (RRF) and cohesion policy programmes strengthen Member States’ long-term growth and resilience by 
supporting major reforms and investments that help address both long-standing and new challenges, such as 
diversifying energy supplies.  
In November 2024, the Commission launched the first implementation cycle of the reformed economic 
governance framework that entered into force on 30 April 2024. The main objectives of the new framework 
are to strengthen Member States’ debt sustainability and promote sustainable and inclusive growth in all 
Member States through growth-enhancing reforms and priority investments. At the centre of the new 
framework are the national medium-term fiscal-structural plans, which set the Member States’ fiscal paths, 
defined in terms of net expenditure growth rates. The plans contain priority reforms and investments and 
cover an adjustment period of four years as a rule. An extended adjustment period (up to seven years) can be 
agreed at the request of the Member State which commits to additional reforms and investments that are 
conducive to economic growth and fiscal sustainability. Bulgaria submitted its four-year national
mediumterm fiscal-structural plan on 27 February 2025. On 12 May 2025, the Commission recommended to the 
Council to endorse Bulgaria’s plan.  
On 19 March 2025, the Commission presented, as part of the ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, an 
ambitious defence package providing financial levers to EU Member States to drive higher investment in 
defence capabilities. As part of this plan, the Commission invited Member States to apply for the activation of 
the national escape clause (NEC) of the Stability and Growth Pact, which will provide them additional 
budgetary space to transition to a durably higher level of defence expenditure, within the EU fiscal rules. The 
amount of the deviation under the escape clause will be capped at 1.5% GDP, available for a period of four 
years. Bulgaria applied for the NEC on 2 May 2025. A new dedicated instrument - Security Action for Europe 
(SAFE) - has been established, with the Commission planning to raise up to EUR 150 billion on the capital 
markets to help EU Member States quickly and substantially increase investments in Europe’s defence 
capabilities. Bulgaria submitted a request to the Council and the Commission to activate the NEC. On 4 June 
2025, the Commission recommended to the Council to activate the NEC for Bulgaria, allowing the country to 
deviate from, and exceed, the net expenditure path that will be set in the Council recommendation endorsing 
its medium-term fiscal plan. 
On 4 June 2025, the Commission published its European Semester Spring 2025 package. To drive long-term 
prosperity and resilience, the EU is aligning its economic governance with a renewed focus on competitiveness 
as presented in the Competitiveness Compass. Through its country-specific recommendations, the European 
Semester reflects the new priorities to boost competitiveness and provides guidance, including to Bulgaria, on 
the necessary reforms and investments at national and regional level. As part of the European Semester 
Spring 2025 package, the Commission recommends that Bulgaria adheres to the maximum growth rates of 
net expenditure in its plan, while making use of the allowance under the NEC for higher defence expenditure.  
Convergence criteria 
The examination of the compatibility of national legislation, including the statutes of national central 
banks of Member States with a derogation, together with Article 130 TFEU and the compliance duty under 
Article 131 TFEU, includes an assessment of observance of the prohibition of monetary financing (Article 123 
TFEU) and the prohibition of privileged access to financial institutions (Article 124 TFEU); the consistency with 
the ESCB’s objectives (Article 127(1) TFEU) and tasks (Article 127(2) TFEU); and other aspects relating to the 
integration of national central banks into the ESCB. 
The first indent of Article 140(1) TFEU defines the price stability criterion as ‘the achievement of a high 
degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which is close to that of, at most, the 
three best performing Member States in terms of price stability’. 
Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria further provides that ‘the criterion on price stability […] 
shall mean that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, 
observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than 1.5 percentage 
points that of, at most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be 
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 18 –
5 
measured by means of the consumer price index on a comparable basis, taking into account differences in 
national definitions’4. 
The sustainability requirement implies that the satisfactory inflation performance must be attributed to the 
behaviour of input costs and other factors that influence price developments in a structural manner, rather 
than the influence of temporary factors. Therefore, the convergence examination includes an assessment of 
the factors that affect the inflation outlook and is complemented by a reference to the most recent 
Commission inflation forecast5.  
The inflation reference value was calculated as 2.8% in April 2025, with Ireland, Finland and Italy being the 
three ‘best-performing Member States’6. 
No Member States were identified as outliers in terms of inflation performance for calculating the reference 
value, as none of their inflation rates deviated by a wide margin from the euro area average due to
countryspecific circumstances. 
The second indent of Article 140(1) TFEU defines the convergence criterion dealing with public finances is 
defined in the as ‘the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having 
achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance 
with Article 126(6)’.  
Furthermore, Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria states that this criterion means that ‘at the 
time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) of the 
said Treaty that an excessive deficit exists’. 
The TFEU refers to the exchange rate criterion in the third indent of Article 140(1) as ‘the observance of 
the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary 
System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro’. 
Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria provides that: ‘The criterion on participation in the 
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System […] shall mean that a Member State has 
respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European 
Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, 
the Member State shall not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against the euro on its own 
initiative for the same period’7. 
The relevant two-year period for assessing exchange rate stability in this report ran from 20 May 2023 to 19 
May 2025. In its assessment of the exchange rate stability criterion, the Commission takes into account 
developments in auxiliary indicators such as foreign reserve developments and short-term interest rates. It 
also takes into account the role of policy measures (including foreign exchange interventions) and 
international financial assistance (wherever relevant) in maintaining exchange rate stability.  
The fourth indent of Article 140(1) TFEU requires ‘the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State 
with a derogation and of its participation in the exchange rate mechanism’ to be ‘reflected in the long-term 
interest rate levels’. 
Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria further states that ‘the criterion on the convergence of 
interest rates […] shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State 
has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage points 
that of, at most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability. Interest rates shall be 
measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities, taking into account 
differences in national definitions’. 
4 For the purpose of the price stability criterion, inflation is measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) defined in 
Regulation (EU) 2016/792. 
5 All forecasts for inflation and other variables in this report are from the Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast. The forecasts 
are based on a set of common assumptions for external variables and on a ‘no policy change’ assumption, but also take into 
consideration measures that are known in sufficient detail. 
6 The respective 12-month average inflation rates were 1.2%, 1.3% and 1.4%. 
7 In assessing compliance with the exchange rate criterion, the Commission examines whether the exchange rate has remained close 
to the ERM II central rate. Reasons for an appreciation may be taken into account, in accordance with the Common Statement on 
Acceding Countries and ERM2 by the Informal ECOFIN Council held in Athens on 5 April 2003.

The interest rate reference value was calculated as 5.1% in April 20258. 
Article 140(1) TFEU also requires the reports to take into account other factors relevant to economic 
integration and convergence. These include the integration of markets, the development of the balance of 
payments on the current account and of unit labour costs and other price indices. The additional factors to be 
considered are important indicators of whether a Member State would integrate into the euro area without 
difficulties. They also broaden the view on the sustainability of convergence. 
The assessment of the degree of sustainable convergence for Bulgaria presented in this report draws on the 
Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast and the policy guidance provided under the European 
Semester. It is informed in particular by: (i) the fiscal surveillance carried out under the Stability and Growth 
Pact and (ii) by the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. It also reflects the Commission’s assessments of 
fiscal sustainability risks and of the national fiscal framework, as well as the implementation of the RRP. 
2. Bulgaria
In the light of its assessment on legal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the convergence 
criteria, and taking into account the additional relevant factors, the Commission considers that 
Bulgaria fulfils the conditions for adopting the euro. 
Legislation in Bulgaria is compatible with the compliance duty under Article 131 TFEU. 
Bulgaria fulfils the criterion on price stability. The average inflation rate in Bulgaria during the 12 
months to April 2025 was 2.7%, below the reference value of 2.8%. A review of a broad range of indicators 
does not identify causes for concern regarding the sustainability of price stability. 
Bulgaria’s annual HICP inflation rate averaged 8.6% in 2023 and decreased to 2.6% in 2024. Annual HICP 
inflation declined from 14.3% in January 2023, flattening at around 2.8% in May-July 2024 before declining 
further and stabilising at 2.1% in October-December 2024. It then rose significantly at the beginning of 2025, 
peaking at 4% in March before decreasing to 2.8% in April 2025. At the beginning of 2023, headline HICP 
inflation was still above HICP inflation excluding energy and food, due to higher energy and food price 
inflation. With the rapid disinflation of fuel and gas prices in 2023, overall inflation remained below core 
inflation for the rest of 2023. In 2024, headline HICP inflation and core inflation remained close to each other, 
as the fall in fuel prices in the second half of 2024 was largely offset by somewhat higher food price 
inflation. The sharp price hikes at the beginning of 2025 covered items both within and outside the core 
inflation basket. These price hikes were largely due to: (i) restored higher VAT rates for bread and restaurants; 
(ii) higher excise duties for tobacco; (iii) increased electricity and gas prices for households; and (iv) higher
8 The reference value for April 2025 was calculated as the simple average of the 12-month average of long-term interest rates of
Ireland (2.8%), Finland (2.9%) and Italy (3.7%), plus two percentage points.
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 20 –
7 
food prices due to increased international food prices. The subsequent decrease in inflation in April was 
largely due to reductions in hospital fees that are part of core inflation and in gas and fuel prices. 
The Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast projects that average annual inflation will increase from 
2.6% in 2024 to 3.6% in 2025 and gradually ease to 1.8% in 2026. The 12-month average inflation rate is 
projected to increase above the projected reference value by the end of 2025, fall back to the reference value 
in the first months of 2026 and stay below it for the rest of 20269. The higher VAT rates for bread and 
restaurants, higher excise duties for tobacco and other administered prices, including electricity, are estimated 
to have a full impact, including second-round effects, of around 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2025. 
These factors, which explain a large part of the temporary rise of inflation in 2025, are not expected to have 
a lasting effect on inflation. Moreover, the higher inflation in 2025 also reflects higher international prices for 
certain food commodities. The growth in unit labour costs moderated significantly in 2024 and, looking 
forward, the disinflation process in the services sector is set to benefit from wage moderation. Overall, private 
sector wage growth, which directly influences price formation, is expected to moderate faster than aggregate 
wage dynamics. On the external side, the pass-through of lower international energy and other commodities 
prices is also projected to keep inflation down, including via second-round effects to transport services. The 
relatively low price level in Bulgaria (about 57% of the euro area average in 2023) suggests potential for 
price level convergence in the long term. 
Bulgaria fulfils the criterion on public finances. Bulgaria is not the subject of a Council Decision on the 
existence of an excessive deficit. The general government deficit widened from 2.0% of GDP in 2023 to 3.0% 
in 2024. The sizeable deterioration of the deficit in 2024 was in one part due to spending increases in public 
sector salaries and in social benefits, particularly on pensions, which were not fully matched by revenue 
increases. The other part, 0.5% of GDP, was due to a one-off statistical recording of settled liabilities for road 
infrastructure works from 2020-2022. The Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast expects the general 
government deficit to decrease to 2.8% of GDP in 2025 and to remain at 2.8% in 2026. The government 
debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 22.9% in 2023 to 24.1% in 2024. It is expected to increase further to 
25.1% in 2025 and 27.1% in 2026. On 27 February 2025, Bulgaria submitted its national medium-term fiscal 
structural plan to the Council and the Commission. The plan includes a commitment to fiscal consolidation in 
2025-2028 in line with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements. On 12 May 2025, the Commission 
recommended to the Council to endorse Bulgaria’s plan. Accounting for the flexibility under the NEC, the net 
expenditure growth for 2025 is expected to be in line with the net expenditure growth ceilings contained in 
Bulgaria’s medium-term plan. Despite the low projected debt level by 2035 (39% of GDP), Bulgaria’s debt 
sustainability risks appear medium in the medium term, with high uncertainty on debt dynamics over the next 
five years based on historical volatility. Bulgaria has the key components of a robust fiscal framework, but 
some difficulties in implementation remain. Bulgaria has a complex system of national fiscal rules in place 
and there is scope to improve key aspects, including further strengthening the mandate of the Fiscal Council.  
9 The Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast does not include the impact of lower fees for hospital services and of decreases in 
other administered prices on inflation in April 2025. When taking into account these measures, the average inflation rate in Bulgaria 
would likely be close to the reference value by the end of 2025.  
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 21 –

Bulgaria fulfils the exchange rate criterion. In July 2020, Bulgaria entered the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism II (ERM II) and had been participating in the mechanism for almost four years at the time of the 
adoption of this report. The Bulgarian lev observes a central rate of 1.95583 to the euro with a standard 
fluctuation band of ±15%. The Bulgarian National Bank pursues its primary objective of price stability through 
an exchange rate anchor as part of a currency board framework. Bulgaria joined ERM II with its existing 
currency board framework in place, as a unilateral commitment, thereby placing no additional obligations on 
the ECB. The lev exchange rate remained at the ERM II central rate for the 2 years covered by the assessment 
without any signs of tensions or devaluation against the euro. Additional indicators, such as developments in 
foreign exchange reserves and short-term interest rates, suggest that investors’ risk perception towards 
Bulgaria has remained favourable. The (negative) spread of the Bulgarian benchmark short-term interest rate 
(i.e. the three-month base interest rate (BIR) to the Euribor) narrowed from -15 basis points at the beginning 
of 2023 to virtually no differential by the end of that year. It then widened slightly throughout 2024 and 
stood at 3 basis points in March 2025. A sizeable buffer of official reserves continues to underpin the 
currency board’s resilience. Upon entering ERM II, Bulgaria committed to implement a set of policy measures 
(known as post-entry commitments) to ensure that its participation in the mechanism is sustainable and that 
it achieves a high degree of economic convergence before adopting the euro. The measures cover four policy 
areas: (i) the non-banking financial sector; (ii) the insolvency framework; (iii) the anti-money laundering 
framework; and (iv) governance of state-owned enterprises.  
Bulgaria fulfils the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates. The average long-term 
interest rate in the 12-months to April 2025 was 3.9%, below the reference value of 5.1%. The Bulgarian 
long-term interest rate has been stable at or close to 4% since April 2023, following two stepwise increases 
in February and March 2023. The long-term interest rate increased from 1.9% in January 2023 to 4.2% in 
March. Thereafter, it remained unchanged at 4.0% for the rest of 2023 and at 3.9% throughout 2024 and up 
to April 2025. The yield spread relative to the German benchmark bond remained within a range of 1.4-1.9% 
from March 2023 to April 2025. 
The Commission has also examined additional factors, including balance of payments developments, the 
integration of markets and the institutional environment. Bulgaria’s external balance (the combined current and 
capital account) improved to 0.7% of GDP in 2023 and was almost in balance (-0.1% of GDP) in 2024. The 
Bulgarian economy is well integrated with the euro area through trade and investment linkages. Selected indicators 
related to the institutional environment show that Bulgaria performs worse than many euro area Member States. 
There are significant challenges related to the rule of law, fight against corruption and regulatory quality. However, 
as part of its participation in the ERM II and in accordance with its RRP, Bulgaria has taken measures to improve its 
institutional framework and the business environment, including in the four areas covered by the post-entry ERM II 
commitments. The financial sector in Bulgaria is smaller and less developed than in the euro area. It is dominated 
by the banking sector, which is well integrated into the euro area’s financial sector (particularly through a high level 
of foreign ownership). The underdevelopment of market-based financing is reflected in the very small markets for 
equity and private sector debt. Continued policy action, including Bulgaria’s entry into a ‘close cooperation’ 
agreement with the ECB in 2020, combined with a favourable macroeconomic environment have reduced risks to 
and vulnerabilities in the financial sector. As part of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, the Commission 
concluded in its Alert Mechanism Report for 2025 that it was not necessary to carry out an in-depth analysis for 
Bulgaria, while pointing to the need to monitor developments in the country’s cost competitiveness, house prices 
and credit flows to households. 
Bulgaria’s RRP includes measures to address a series of structural challenges, in synergy with other EU funds, 
including cohesion policy funds, to boost its competitiveness and stimulate sustainable growth, and reduce 
the country’s regional and social disparities. The RRF funding provides Bulgaria with EUR 5.7 billion in grants 
over the 2021-2026 period. Bulgaria received one disbursement of EUR 1.37 billion on 16 December 2022. In 
April 2025, Bulgaria submitted a comprehensive revision of its RRP with the aim to bring it back on track. 
Implementing key outstanding reforms in the areas of decarbonisation, business environment and rule of law 
remains important for achieving the plan’s objectives. It would thus be important for Bulgaria to urgently step 
up its implementation of reforms and investments in order to deliver on the plan’s commitments. In addition, 
cohesion policy funding provides Bulgaria with EUR 10.7 billion for the 2021-2027 period. Cohesion policy 
financing aims in particular to further support Bulgaria’s competitiveness, green transition, including energy 
independence, the just transition and climate change resilience. It also aims to support the country’s upward 
social convergence, including by addressing labour shortages, further developing educational and training 
systems and making them more inclusive for disadvantaged groups. Bulgaria has made progress in 
implementing EU cohesion policy but challenges remain.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. ROLE OF THE REPORT 
The euro was introduced on 1 January 1999 by eleven Member States, namely Austria, Belgium, 
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. 
Subsequently, Greece (2001), Slovenia (2007), Cyprus and Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia 
(2011), Latvia (2014), Lithuania (2015) and Croatia (2023) also adopted the euro. 
Member States for which the Council has not yet decided that they fulfil the necessary conditions 
for the adoption of the euro are referred to as ‘Member States with a derogation’. Article 140 of 
the Treaty lays down provisions and procedures for examining the convergence situation of 
Member States with a derogation (Box 1.1). At least once every two years, or at the request of a 
Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) prepare 
Convergence Reports for such Member States. Denmark negotiated an opt-out arrangement before 
the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty (10) and does not participate in the third stage of EMU. Until 
Denmark indicates that it wishes to participate in the third stage and adopt the euro, it will not be 
the subject of an assessment as to whether it fulfils the necessary conditions for such a 
participation. 
In 2024, the Commission and the ECB adopted their latest regular Convergence Reports (11). None 
of the Member States assessed in those reports was deemed to meet the necessary conditions for 
adopting the euro.  
On 25 February 2025, Bulgaria submitted a request for a convergence assessment. This 
Commission Staff Working Document is a Technical Annex to the Convergence Report 2025 on 
Bulgaria and includes a detailed assessment of the progress with convergence, as required by 
Article 140(1) of the Treaty. 
The convergence assessment in this report is presented against the background of several major 
economic and policy developments. Following the EU’s weak economic performance in 2023, when 
GDP grew by 0.4%, the economy returned to moderate growth of 1.0% in 2024, with stronger 
momentum at the end of the year. In 2024, private consumption was supported by continued 
growth in real wages and higher employment, with a remarkably strong labour market. The 
disinflationary process that started towards the end of 2022 continued to progress throughout 
much of 2024, with EU headline inflation averaging 2.6% that year, and is expected to continue in 
2025. Inflation divergence across the EU Member States also narrowed significantly in 2024. With 
the disinflation process well on track, in April 2025 the ECB cut its main policy rate for the seventh 
time since June 2024, to 2.25%.  
The economic outlook, including the Commission’s 2025 Spring Economic Forecast for HICP 
inflation for the EU as a whole and for individual Member States, is characterised by an unusually 
high degree of uncertainty. In early 2025, the EU and global economies were hit by the most 
significant policy-induced trade and economic uncertainty shock in decades. It is unclear what the 
landing zone for the US tariffs vis-à-vis trading partners would be, which forces the Commission 
forecast to rely on several technical assumptions (12). Beyond trade, broader geopolitical tensions 
remain elevated, heightening uncertainty risks, weighing on confidence, and posing significant risks 
to the economic outlook.

(12) Significantly, the individualised ‘reciprocal’ higher tariffs are assumed to not be reinstated at the expiry of the 90 days
suspension. The forecast also assumes that the exceptionally high tariffs on Chinese imports, imposed after April 2, will
be scaled back to pre-escalation levels, as they are deemed unsustainable. By the time the Commission forecast was
published, on 19 May 2025, the new tariffs in place were lower than those assumed at the cut-off date.

The expected acceleration in implementing the recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) and the 
cohesion policy programmes can at least partly offset the negative consequences of the weaker  
international environment and play a crucial role in the convergence process of non-euro area EU 
Member States. Besides contributing to higher growth and improved public finances in the near 
term, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and cohesion policy programmes strengthen 
Member States’ long-term growth and resilience by supporting major reforms and investments 
that help address both long-standing and new challenges, such as diversifying energy supplies. The 
overall implementation of the RRPs progressed in 2024 and in the first four months of 2025. By 
the end of 2024, RRF disbursements reached EUR 306 billion, which is close to half of the total 
amount of support committed under the RRF. However, in a few Member States, including Bulgaria, 
Box 1.1: Article 140 of the Treaty 
‘1. At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the 
Commission and the European Central Bank shall report to the Council on the progress made by the 
Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of economic 
and monetary union. These reports shall include an examination of the compatibility between the 
national legislation of each of these Member States, including the statutes of its national central bank, 
and Articles 130 and 131 and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB. The reports shall also examine 
the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each 
Member State of the following criteria: 
— the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation 
which is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability, 
— the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved 
a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with 
Article 126(6), 
— the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of 
the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro, 
— the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its 
participation in the exchange-rate mechanism being reflected in the long-term interest-rate levels. 
The four criteria mentioned in this paragraph and the relevant periods over which they are to be 
respected are developed further in a Protocol annexed to the Treaties. The reports of the Commission 
and the European Central Bank shall also take account of the results of the integration of markets, the 
situation and development of the balances of payments on current account and an examination of the 
development of unit labour costs and other price indices. 
2. After consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the European Council, the Council
shall, on a proposal from the Commission, decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the
necessary conditions on the basis of the criteria set out in paragraph 1, and abrogate the derogations
of the Member States concerned.
The Council shall act having received a recommendation of a qualified majority of those among its 
members representing Member States whose currency is the euro. These members shall act within six 
months of the Council receiving the Commission's proposal. 
The qualified majority of the said members, as referred to in the second subparagraph, shall be defined 
in accordance with Article 238(3)(a). 
3. If it is decided, in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph 2, to abrogate a derogation,
the Council shall, acting with the unanimity of the Member States whose currency is the euro and the
Member State concerned, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European
Central Bank, irrevocably fix the rate at which the euro shall be substituted for the currency of the
Member State concerned, and take the other measures necessary for the introduction of the euro as
the single currency in the Member State concerned.’

Chapter 1 - Introduction

there are significant delays in the RRF implementation. In addition, EU Cohesion Policy funds 
provide EUR 378 billion to Member States for the 2021-2027 period. Cohesion policy concentrates 
in fields that are critical for promoting convergence and competitiveness through long-term 
investment in line with EU priorities and will support EU GDP growth, with a particularly high 
impact in the Member States and regions that are the main beneficiaries of the policy. 
In November 2024, the Commission launched the first implementation cycle of the reformed 
economic governance framework that entered into force on 30 April 2024. The main objectives of 
the new framework are to strengthen Member States’ debt sustainability and promote sustainable 
and inclusive growth in all Member States through growth-enhancing reforms and priority 
investments. At the centre of the new framework are the national medium-term fiscal-structural 
plans, which set the Member States’ fiscal paths, defined in terms of net expenditure growth rates. 
The plans contain priority reforms and investments and cover an adjustment period of four years 
as a rule. An extended adjustment period (up to seven years) can be agreed at the request of the 
Member State which commits to additional reforms and investments that are conducive to 
economic growth and fiscal sustainability. Bulgaria submitted its four-year national medium-term 
fiscal-structural plan on 27 February 2025. On 12 May 2025, the Commission recommended to 
the Council to endorse Bulgaria’s plan.  
On 19 March 2025, the Commission presented, as part of the ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, 
an ambitious defence package providing financial levers to EU Member States to drive an 
investment surge in defence capabilities. As part of this plan, the Commission invited Member 
States to apply for the activation of the national escape clause (NEC) of the Stability and Growth 
Pact, which will provide them additional budgetary space to transition to a durably higher level of 
defence expenditure, within the EU fiscal rules. The amount of the planned deviation under the 
escape clause will be capped at 1.5% GDP, available for a period of four years. A new dedicated 
instrument - Security Action for Europe (SAFE) - has been established, with the Commission 
planning to raise up to EUR 150 billion on the capital markets to help EU Member States quickly 
and substantially increase investments in Europe’s defence capabilities. Bulgaria submitted a 
request, to the Council and the Commission, to activate the NEC. On 4 June 2025, the Commission 
recommended to the Council to activate the NEC for Bulgaria, allowing the country to deviate from, 
and exceed, the net expenditure path that will be set in the Council recommendation endorsing its 
medium-term fiscal plan. 
On 4 June 2025, the Commission published its European Semester Spring 2025 package. To drive 
long-term prosperity and resilience, the EU is aligning its economic governance with a renewed 
focus on competitiveness as presented in the Competitiveness Compass. Through its
countryspecific recommendations, the European Semester reflects the new priorities to boost 
competitiveness and provides guidance, including to Bulgaria, on the necessary reforms and 
investments at national and regional level. As part of the European Semester Spring 2025 
package, the Commission recommends that Bulgaria adheres to the maximum growth rates of net 
expenditure in its plan, while making use of the allowance under the NEC for higher defence 
expenditure.  
The remainder of the first chapter presents the methodology used for the application of the 
assessment criteria. Chapters 2 to 7 examine the fulfilment of the convergence criteria and other 
requirements in the order in which they appear in Article 140(1) (see Box 1.1). The cut-off date for 
the statistical data included in this convergence report was 19 May 2025. 
1.2. APPLICATION OF THE CRITERIA 
In accordance with Article 140(1) of the Treaty, the Convergence Reports shall examine the 
compatibility of national legislation with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the Statute of the 
European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and of the European Central Bank. The reports shall also 
examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the 
fulfilment of the four convergence criteria dealing with price stability, public finances, exchange 
rate stability and long-term interest rates as well as some additional factors. The four convergence

European Commission 
Convergence Report 2025 on Bulgaria  
14 
criteria are developed further in a Protocol annexed to the Treaty (Protocol No 13 on the 
convergence criteria). 
1.2.1. Compatibility of legislation 
In accordance with Article 140(1) of the Treaty, the legal examination includes an assessment of 
compatibility between a Member State’s legislation, including the statute of its national central 
bank, and Article 130 and 131 of the Treaty. This assessment mainly covers three areas. 
• First, the independence of the national central bank and of the members of its decision-making
bodies, as laid down in Article 130, must be assessed. This assessment covers all issues linked
to a national central bank’s institutional and financial independence and to the personal
independence of the members of its decision-making bodies.
• Second, in accordance with Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty, the compliance of the national
legislation is verified against the prohibition of monetary financing and privileged access. The
prohibition of monetary financing is laid down in Article 123(1) of the Treaty, which prohibits
overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the ECB or the central banks of
Member States in favour of Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments,
regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public
undertakings of Member States; and the purchase directly from these public sector entities by
the ECB or central banks of debt instruments. As regards the prohibition on privileged access as
set out in Article 124, the central banks, as public authorities, may not take measures granting
privileged access by the public sector to financial institutions if such measures are not based
on prudential considerations.
• Third, in accordance with Article 131, the integration of the national central bank into the ESCB
has to be examined, in order to ensure that at the latest by the moment of euro adoption, the
objectives of the national central bank are compatible with the objectives of the ESCB as
formulated in Article 127 of the Treaty. The national provisions on the tasks of the national
central bank are assessed against the relevant rules of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
1.2.2. Price stability 
The price stability criterion is defined in the first indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty: ‘the 
achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which 
is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability’. 
Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria further stipulates that ‘the criterion on price 
stability […] shall mean that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an 
average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not 
exceed by more than 1.5 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member 
States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the consumer price index 
on a comparable basis, taking into account differences in national definitions. 
Since national consumer price indices (CPIs) diverge substantially in terms of concepts, methods 
and practices, they do not constitute the appropriate means to meet the Treaty requirement that 
inflation must be measured on a comparable basis. To this end, the Council adopted on 23 October 
1995 a framework regulation (13) setting the legal basis for the establishment of a harmonised 
methodology for compiling consumer price indices in the Member States. This process resulted in

Box 1.2: Assessment of price stability and the reference value
The numerical part of the price stability criterion implies a comparison between a Member State's 
average price performance and a reference value.  
A Member State’s average rate of inflation is measured by the percentage change in the unweighted 
average of the last 12 monthly indices relative to the unweighted average of the 12 monthly indices of 
the previous period, rounded to one decimal. This measure captures inflation trends over a period of 
one year as requested by the provisions of the Treaty. Using the commonly used inflation rate – 
calculated as the percentage change in the consumer price index of the latest month over the index for 
the equivalent month of the previous year – would not meet the one-year requirement. The latter may 
also be excessively volatile from month to month and excessively affected by temporary factors.  
The reference value is calculated as the unweighted average of the average rates of inflation of, at 
most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1.5 percentage points. 
The outcome is rounded to one decimal. While in principle the reference value could also be calculated 
on the basis of the price performance of only one or two best performing Member States in terms of 
price stability, it has been existing practice to select the three best performers. Defining the reference 
value in a relative way (as opposed to a fixed reference value) allows taking into account the effects of 
a common shock that affects inflation rates across all Member States.  
As Article 140(1) of the Treaty refers to ‘Member States’ and does not make a distinction between euro 
area and other Member States, the convergence reports select the three best performers from all 
Member States – EU-15 for the convergence reports before 2004, EU-25 for the reports between 2004

Convergence Report 2025 on Bulgaria

As has been the case in past convergence reports, a Member State’s average rate of inflation is 
measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of the last 12 monthly indices 
relative to the arithmetic average of the 12 monthly indices of the previous period. The reference 
value is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average rate of inflation of the three ‘
bestperforming EU Member States in terms of price stability’ plus 1.5 percentage points (see Box 1.2). 
Accordingly, the reference value is currently 2.8%, based on the data of Ireland (1.2%), Finland 
(1.3%) and Italy (1.4%) over the 12-month period covering May 2024 – April 2025. No Member 
States were identified as outliers in terms of inflation performance for the calculation of the 
reference value, as none of their inflation rates deviated by a wide margin from the euro area 
average due to country-specific circumstances (see Box 1.2).    
The Protocol on the convergence criteria not only requires Member States to have achieved a high 
degree of price stability but also calls for a price performance that is sustainable. The requirement 
of sustainability aims at ensuring that the degree of price stability and inflation convergence 
achieved in previous years will be maintained after adoption of the euro. This deserves particular 
attention as sustained divergences in price developments in one or more euro area Member States 
can lead to the emergence of competitiveness losses that must be corrected via painful 
adjustment processes and can trigger negative spillover effects on other Member States. 
Inflation sustainability implies that the satisfactory inflation performance must essentially be due 
to the adequate behaviour of input costs and other factors that influence price developments in a 
structural manner, rather than reflecting the influence of cyclical or temporary factors. Therefore, 
this Technical Annex also takes account of the role of the macroeconomic situation and cyclical 
position in the inflation performance, of developments in unit labour costs as a result of trends in 
labour productivity and nominal compensation per head, and of developments in import prices to 
assess how external price developments have impacted on domestic inflation. Similarly, the impact 
of administered prices and indirect taxes on headline inflation is also considered. 
From a forward-looking perspective, the report includes an assessment of medium-term prospects 
for price developments. The analysis of factors that have an impact on the inflation outlook is 
complemented by the projections from the most recent Commission inflation forecast.
Mediumterm inflation prospects are also assessed by reference to the economies’ key structural 
characteristics, including the functioning of the labour and product markets. 
Box (continued) 
and 2006, EU-27 for reports between 2007 and 2013, EU-28 for reports between 2014 and 2018 and 
EU-27 for the reports between 2020 and 2024.  
The notion of ‘best performer in terms of price stability’ is not defined explicitly in the 
Treaty. It is appropriate to interpret this notion in a non-mechanical manner, taking into 
account the state of the economic environment and country-specific factors at the time of 
the assessment. In particular, an outlier analysis should be performed to identify those countries 
whose inflation rates cannot be seen as meaningful benchmarks. These outliers are identified on 
the basis of two criteria taken in combination: i) an inflation rate substantially below the euro 
area average; and ii) an inflation rate driven by country-specific factors that cannot be seen 
as representative of the process that is driving inflation in the euro area. In this convergence 
report, no Member States were identified as outliers in terms of inflation performance for the 
calculation of the reference value, as none of their inflation rates deviated by a wide margin 
from the euro area average due to country-specific circumstances (1).

1.2.3. Public finances 
The convergence criterion dealing with the government budgetary position is defined in the second 
indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty as ‘the sustainability of the government financial position; 
this will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that 
is excessive as determined in accordance with Article 126(6)’. Furthermore, Article 2 of the Protocol 
on the convergence criteria states that this criterion means that ‘at the time of the examination 
the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) of the said Treaty 
that an excessive deficit exists’. 
The convergence assessment in the budgetary area is thus directly linked to the excessive deficit 
procedure which is specified in Article 126 of the Treaty and further clarified in the Stability and 
Growth Pact (see Box 1.3 for further information on the excessive deficit procedure as 
strengthened by the 2024 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact). The details of the excessive 
deficit procedure are defined in Regulation 1467/97 as amended in 2024 which sets out the way 
in which government deficit and debt levels are assessed to determine whether an excessive 
deficit exists, under Article 126 of TFEU. The convergence assessment of the budgetary position is 
therefore judged by whether the Member State is subject to a Council decision under 126(6) on the 
existence of an excessive deficit (14). 
On 4 June 2025, the Commission adopted a report under Article 126(3) of the TFEU for 4 Member 
States. The report did not cover Bulgaria, as its government deficit in 2024 did not exceed 3.0% of 
GDP.    
In the context of the European Semester, the country-specific recommendations for 2025 invite 
Member States to reinforce overall defence spending and readiness in line with the European 
Council conclusions of 6 March 2025. Member States are called to adhere to the maximum growth 
rates of net expenditure recommended by the Council, while - where relevant - making use of the 
allowance under the national escape clause for higher defence expenditure. 
(14) The definitions of the government deficit and debt used in this report are in accordance with the excessive deficit
procedure, as was the case in previous convergence reports. These definitions are laid out in the amended Council
Regulation (EC) No 479/2009. In particular, government debt is general government consolidated gross debt at nominal
value. Information regarding the excessive deficit procedure and its application to different Member States since 2002
can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/deficit/index_en.htm.

Box 1.3: Excessive Deficit Procedures under the new EU fiscal framework
The new EU fiscal framework was adopted on 29 April 2024. The rules on the opening of a
deficitbased Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) remain unchanged while the rules on the opening of a
debtbased EDP are changed and clarified in the amended Council Regulation (EC) 1467/97. (1)  
In order to simplify the EU fiscal framework and increase transparency, a single operational indicator 
(net expenditure) anchored in debt sustainability serves as a basis for setting the fiscal path and for 
carrying out annual fiscal surveillance. Net expenditure means government expenditure net of interest 
expenditure, discretionary revenue measures, expenditure on Union programmes fully matched by 
revenue from Union funds, national expenditure on co-financing of programmes funded by the Union, 
as well as cyclical elements of unemployment benefit expenditure. One-offs and other temporary 
measures will also be excluded from the net expenditure indicator.  
The EDP is specified in Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). 
Protocol 12 of the Treaty gives further details on the excessive deficit procedure, including the 
reference values on deficit and debt. Council Regulation (EC) 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying 
the implementation of the EDP (the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact) clarifies the 
implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Together, these provisions determine the steps to 
be followed to reach a Council decision on the existence and correction of an excessive deficit. 
The Commission will produce reports under Article 126(3) of TFEU on the basis of the following criteria: 
• whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds
3% of GDP, unless:
− the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to
the reference value;
− or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is exceptional and temporary and the
ratio remains close to the reference value;
• when the ratio of the government debt to GDP exceeds 60% of GDP, the budgetary position is not
close to balance (2) or in surplus and when the deviations recorded in the control account (3) of the
Member State exceed the established annual or cumulative thresholds (0.3% and 0.6% of GDP
respectively).
When assessing the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(3) TFEU, the 
Commission should take into account all relevant factors. Substantial public debt challenges in the 
Member State concerned should be considered a key aggravating factor. The increase of government 
investment in defence, where applicable, should be considered as a relevant factor when assessing the 
existence of an excessive deficit. The Commission shall give due and express consideration to any other 
factors which, in the opinion of the Member State concerned, are relevant in order to comprehensively 
assess compliance with the deficit and debt criteria and which the Member State has put forward to the 
Council and the Commission. In that context, particular consideration shall be given to financial 
contributions to fostering international solidarity and achieving the common priorities of the Union

1.2.4. Exchange rate stability 
The Treaty refers to the exchange rate criterion in the third indent of Article 140(1) as ’the 
observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of 
the European Monetary System, for at least 2 years, without devaluing against the euro’. 
Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria stipulates: ’The criterion on participation in the 
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System […] shall mean that a Member State 
has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the 
European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last 2 years before the 
examination. In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central 
rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period’ (15). Based on the Council Resolution 
on the establishment of the ERM II (16), the European Monetary System has been replaced by the 
Exchange Rate Mechanism II upon the introduction of the euro, and the euro has become the 
centre of the mechanism. 
(15) In assessing compliance with the exchange rate criterion, the Commission examines whether the exchange rate has
remained close to the ERM II central rate, while reasons for an appreciation may be taken into account, in accordance
with the Common Statement on Acceding Countries and ERM II by the Informal ECOFIN Council, Athens, 5 April 2003.

Box (continued) 
referred to in the new preventive arm Regulation. (4) For deficit-based EDPs, the relevant factors can be 
considered for i) those Member States with debt below 60% and ii) those Member States with debt 
exceeding 60% of GDP and satisfying the double condition of the overarching principle, i.e. that the 
general government deficit remains close to the 3% of GDP reference value and its excess over the 
reference value is temporary.
In the next step of the procedure, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) should formulate an 
opinion in accordance with Article 126(4) TFEU within two weeks of the adoption by the Commission 
of a report issued in accordance with Article 126(3) TFEU. Taking fully into account this opinion, the 
Commission, if it considers that an excessive deficit exists, should address an opinion and a proposal 
to the Council in accordance with Article 126(5) and (6) TFEU and inform the European Parliament 
thereof. The Council should then decide on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with 
Article 126(6) TFEU, as a rule within four months of the reporting dates established in Article 3(2) and 
(3) of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009. When it decides that an excessive deficit exists, the Council should
at the same time make recommendations to the Member State concerned in accordance with Article
126(7) TFEU.
In its recommendation, the Council shall request that the Member State implements a corrective net 
expenditure path which ensures that the general government deficit remains or is brought and 
maintained below the reference value within the deadline set in the recommendation. The corrective 
path should also ensure that the debt is kept on a plausibly downward path or remains at prudent 
levels below 60% of GDP in the medium term. In the case of a debt-based EDP, the corrective net 
expenditure path shall be at least as demanding as the net expenditure path under the preventive arm 
from which the Member State deviated and correct as a rule the cumulated deviations of the control 
account.(5)

Box 1.4: A reinforced approach to ERM II participation by means of upfront policy 
commitments by the applicant Member States
Participating in ERM II is an essential step for a Member State with a derogation on the way to fulfil 
the exchange rate criterion and to euro adoption. Fulfilling the exchange rate criterion through the 
smooth participation in ERM II is provided for in Article 140 of the TFEU, Protocol No 13 to the TFEU 
on the convergence criteria and the Resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an 
exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union adopted in Amsterdam 
on 16 June 1997 (1). In accordance with this framework, ERM II entry of a Member State with a 
derogation requires a mutual agreement of all ‘ERM II parties’. These include the finance ministers of 
euro area Member States, the European Central Bank, and the finance ministers and the central bank 
governors of the non-euro area Member States participating in ERM II. The European Commission 
provides analytical support to the ERM II process, but has no voting right and no right of initiative in 
the ERM II entry process. 
In July 2018, learning from past episodes of economic overheating in ERM II and the euro-area crisis, 
the ERM II parties clarified the modalities of a reinforced approach for future ERM II participation with 
a view of ensuring a smooth transition to, and participation in, ERM II, in their statement on Bulgaria’s 
path towards ERM II, stating that this approach would apply to all Member States wishing to join ERM 
II from then onwards (2). The reinforced approach was confirmed in the later statement of the ERM II 
parties of July 2019 on Croatia’s path towards ERM II participation (3). 
According to this reinforced approach, the applicant Member State and ERM II parties agree on a 
number of policy commitments to be implemented by the former before joining ERM II. This package 
of so called prior policy commitments aims at maximising the country’s chances to operate smoothly 
in ERM II. It is country-specific, targeted and covers policy areas that are highly relevant for a smooth 
transition to and participation in ERM II including, for instance institutional quality, governance, the 
financial sector, fiscal policy, or the business environment. 
In particular, as being part of the euro area now also implies for a Member State to be part of the 
Banking Union’s pillars of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the Single Resolution 
Mechanism (SRM), the applicant Member State is expected to enter into ‘close cooperation’ with the 
ECB for banking supervision purposes at the latest by the time of its participation in ERM II. A Member 
State with a derogation can join the Banking Union before its euro adoption via an arrangement called 
‘close cooperation’. Entering in close cooperation with the ECB means that the significant credit 
institutions established in the country concerned are supervised by the ECB via the involvement of the 
domestic national supervisor. Entering in close cooperation also implies participation in the Single 
Resolution Mechanism, including the Single Resolution Fund. 
In terms of process, the ECB and the Commission monitor the fulfilment of the prior-commitments 
undertaken by the applicant Member States in the respective areas of competence of the ECB and the 
Union and in close cooperation with the Member State concerned. The two institutions regularly inform 
ERM II parties on the progress made with the prior-commitments. A comprehensive assessment of the 
applicants’ banking sector is carried out by the ECB as part of the process of establishing close 
cooperation with the ECB. This includes an asset quality review and a stress test that aims at assessing 
whether banks are fundamentally sound. The results of the comprehensive assessment are made 
public on the ECB’s website (4).

In its assessment of the exchange rate stability criterion, the Commission takes into account 
developments in auxiliary indicators such as foreign reserve developments and short-term interest 
rates, as well as the role of policy measures, including foreign exchange interventions, and 
international financial assistance wherever relevant, in maintaining exchange rate stability. 
The assessment of this criterion verifies the participation in ERM II (see Box 1.4 for further 
information on ERM II participation) and examines exchange rate behaviour within the mechanism. 
The relevant period for assessing exchange rate stability in this Technical Annex is 20 May 2023 to 
19 May 2025. 
 
1.2.5. Long-term interest rates 
The fourth indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires that ’the durability of convergence 
achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its participation in the exchange rate 
mechanism’ is ’reflected in the long-term interest rate levels’. Article 4 of the Protocol on the 
convergence criteria further stipulates that ’the criterion on the convergence of interest rates […] 
shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has 
had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage 
points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. 
Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable 
securities, taking into account differences in national definitions’ (see Box 1.5). 
Box (continued) 
 
  
 
 
In line with the long-standing ERM II practice, ERM II parties also expect applicant Member States to 
take further policy commitments at the moment of joining ERM II with the aim of achieving a high 
degree of sustainable economic convergence by the time the euro will be adopted. 
At the time of writing this report, Bulgaria and Denmark were the only non-euro-area Member States 
participating in ERM II. Bulgaria joined the ERM II on 10 July 2020 after having completed its prior 
policy commitments (5). Bulgaria established close cooperation with the ECB. In addition, the prior policy 
commitments of the Bulgarian authorities covered measures related to the macroprudential 
framework, the supervision of the non-banking financial sector, the insolvency framework, the
antimoney laundering framework and the governance of state-owned enterprises (6).  
At the time of ERM II entry, the Bulgarian authorities also committed to pursue sound economic policies 
with the aim of preserving economic and financial stability and achieving a high degree of sustainable 
economic convergence. In particular, the Bulgarian authorities committed to implement specific policy 
measures (the so-called post-ERM II entry commitments) on the non-banking financial sector,
stateowned enterprises, the insolvency framework and the anti-money laundering framework (7).

For the assessment of the criterion on the convergence of interest rates, yields on benchmark 
long-term bonds have been taken, using an average rate over the latest 12 months. The reference 
value for April 2025 is calculated as the simple average of the average long-term interest rates in 
Ireland (2.8%), Finland (2.9%) and Italy (3.7%) plus 2 percentage points, yielding a reference value 
of 5.1%.  
1.2.6. Additional factors 
Article 140(1) TFEU also requires that the reports take into account other factors relevant to 
economic integration and convergence. These additional factors include financial, product and 
labour market integration and the development of the balance of payments. The analysis of the 
development of unit labour costs and other price indices, which is also prescribed by Article 140 of 
the Treaty, is covered in the price stability section. 
The assessment of additional factors gives an important indication of a Member State’s ability to 
integrate into the euro area without difficulties. As regards the balance of payments, the focus is 
on the situation and development of the external balance (17). Market integration is assessed 
(17) The external balance is defined as the combined current and capital account (net lending/borrowing vis-à-vis the rest of 
the world). This concept permits in particular to take full account of external transfers (including EU transfers), which
are partly recorded in the capital account. It is the concept closest to the current account as defined when the
Maastricht Treaty was drafted. 
Box 1.5: Data for the interest rate convergence
The fourth indent of Article 140(l) of the Treaty requires that the durability of nominal convergence 
and exchange rate stability in Member States should be assessed by reference to long-term interest 
rates. Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria adds that these ‘Interest rates shall be 
measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable securities, taking into account 
differences in national definitions’. 
Article 5 of the Protocol requires that the Commission should provide the statistical data used for the 
application of the convergence criteria. However, in the context of the interest rate criterion, the ECB 
has developed the criteria for harmonising the series of 10-year benchmark bond yields on behalf of 
Eurostat and collects the data from the central banks. The selection of bonds for inclusion in this series 
is based on the following criteria: 
• issued by a central government;
• a residual maturity as close as possible to 10 years;
• adequate liquidity, which is the main selection criterion; the choice between a single benchmark or
the simple average of a sample is based on this requirement;
• fixed coupon;

through trade, foreign direct investment and a smooth functioning of the internal market. 
Moreover, progress in financial integration is examined, together with the main characteristics, 
structures and trends of the financial sector. Given that Member States which adopt the euro also 
participate in the banking union, developments in national banking sectors are specifically looked 
at as well. 
Starting with the 2012 Convergence Report, the convergence assessment is aligned with the 
broader European Semester approach which takes an integrated look at the economic policy 
challenges facing EMU in ensuring fiscal sustainability, competitiveness, financial market stability 
and economic growth. 
The section on additional factors makes reference to the surveillance of macroeconomic 
imbalances under the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (18).

2. BULGARIA
25 
2.1. LEGAL COMPATIBILITY 
2.1.1. Introduction 
The legal basis for the Bulgarska Narodna Banka (the BNB – Bulgaria’s central bank), the Law on 
the Bulgarian National Bank (the BNB Law) of 2024 (19), has been amended since the 2024 
Convergence Report by the Law on the State Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria for 2025 (Law on 
State Budget) (20). The Bulgarian authorities have amended the BNB Law to remedy the 
incompatibility highlighted in the Commission's 2024 Convergence Report. In particular, this 
concerns issues flagged in the section on central bank independence in relation to Article 99(5) of 
the Bulgarian Constitution (21). In accordance with paragraph 14 of its transitional and final 
provisions, the BNB Law shall enter into force on the date specified in the Council Decision on the 
adoption of the euro by Bulgaria. The entry into force would therefore be automatic and would not 
require further action from the Bulgarian authorities. The BNB Law will replace and repeal the 
previous BNB Law (22). Once it enters into force, the BNB Law is compatible with the relevant 
provisions of the EU law. 
2.1.2. Central bank independence 
Article 15(3) of the BNB Law provides that the grounds for the early dismissal of a member of the 
Governing Council, with the exception of the Governor, shall be established by a decision of the 
Governing Council. A member of the Governing Council whose dismissal is proposed shall cease to 
exercise their powers from the day of the Governing Council’s decision. The Governing Council’s 
decision is subject to appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court within 7 days. The Supreme 
Administrative Court gives its decision within 14 days of receipt of the appeal. This decision is final. 
Ensuring personal independence requires that national legislation should allow reasonable time for 
appealing a dismissal decision as well as for the judicial review to take place for appealing. The 
short time-limit for the appeal and the very constrained timeframe for the judicial procedure in 
Article 15(3) may be seen as a residual imperfection that Bulgaria should consider addressing in 
the near future.   
The Bulgarian Constitution has been amended in January 2024 in a matter that could indirectly 
impact the BNB’s independence. The new Article 99(5) of the Bulgarian Constitution provides that, 
in a case where no agreement is reached on the formation of a government, the President, 
following consultations with the parliamentary groups and acting on a motion by the caretaker 
prime minister-designate, appoints a caretaker cabinet, and schedules new elections within 
2 months. A caretaker prime minister is to be appointed from among the Chairperson of the 
National Assembly, the Governor or a Deputy Governor of the BNB, the President or a Vice-
President of the Bulgarian National Audit Office, and the Ombudsman (or a deputy thereof). 
The appointment as caretaker prime minister of the Governor or one of the Deputy Governors of 
the BNB could disrupt its effective and independent functioning. This would be potentially a serious 
cause for concern. The appointment would only be for a limited period (until a regular government 
is formed), but the caretaker government could be reappointed for several successive periods as 
long as election results do not result in the formation of a government and new elections have to 
be scheduled. To avoid such potential disruption and its possible impact on the BNB’s 
independence, one possible solution stated in the Commission Convergence Report 2024 was the 
(19) Law on Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), Darjaven vestnik issue 13, 13.2.2024.
(20) Law on the State Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria for 2025, Decree No. 53, 21.3.2025, Darjaven vestnik issue 26,

(21) Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, Darjaven vestnik issue 56, 13.7.1991.
(22) Law on Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), Darjaven vestnik issue 46, 10.6.1997.

amendment of the BNB Law to provide sufficient and effective safeguards for the BNB’s 
independence as required by EU law. Firstly, any appointment of the Governor or a Deputy 
Governor of the BNB as a caretaker prime minister should be conditional on their explicit consent 
and they should be empowered to refuse such an appointment. Secondly, if such consent is 
expressed, the rules should prevent that person from holding both positions simultaneously, 
because this could lead to conflicts of interest and lack of independence. In this respect, the 
effective and independent functioning of the BNB must be preserved. This could be ensured 
through the person’s resignation from their post at the BNB at the time of their appointment as 
caretaker prime minister.  
Article 13 of the BNB Law has been amended by paragraph 32 of the Transitional and Final 
provisions of the Law on the State Budget, published on 27 March 2025, and a new paragraph (5) 
has been added, stating that in the event that the Governor or Deputy Governor has expressed the 
explicit consent to be appointed as caretaker prime minister (Acting Prime Minister) under the 
procedure of Article 99, paragraph 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, he/she shall 
resign. The Governor or Deputy Governor has the right to refuse to be appointed as caretaker 
prime minister (Acting Prime Minister) under the procedure of Article 99, paragraph 5 of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. The Commission also welcomes the amendments made to 
paragraph (4) of Article 13 according to which, in the event of the appointment of the Governor or 
Deputy Governor as caretaker prime minister (Acting Prime Minister) under the procedure of Art. 
99, para. 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, the appointment of a new Governor, 
respectively Deputy Governor, shall be held no later than one month from the termination of the 
powers under the procedure of paragraph 8 of the BNB Law. Until the appointment, the powers of 
the Governor shall be exercised by a deputy designated by him from among the Deputy Governors, 
and for a Deputy Governor, Art. 20, paragraph 4 of the BNB Law shall apply. This procedure 
ensures the continuity of central bank’s activities in case of appointment of the Governor or Deputy 
Governor as caretaker prime minister (Acting Prime Minister).  
Therefore, the incompatibility mentioned in the Commission’s Convergence Report 2024 in this 
area has been resolved. 
2.1.3. Prohibition of monetary financing and privileged access 
There are no incompatibilities and imperfections in the BNB Law with regard to the prohibition of 
monetary financing and privileged access, as enshrined in Article 123 and 124 of the TFEU. 
2.1.4. Integration into the ESCB 
Objectives 
The objectives of the BNB  are compatible with the TFEU. 
Tasks 
There are no incompatibilities and imperfections in the BNB Law with regard to the tasks of the 
ESCB and the ECB. 
2.1.5. Assessment of compatibility 
The Bulgarian authorities have taken measures to remedy the incompatibility that was identified in 
the 2024 Convergence Report. The BNB Law is compatible with Article 130 and Article 131 of the 
TFEU and the ESCB/ECB Statute.

2.2. PRICE STABILITY 
2.2.1. Respect of the reference value 
The 12-month average inflation rate, which is used for the convergence assessment, was above 
the reference value at the time of the last convergence assessment of Bulgaria in 2024. The 12-
month average inflation rate decreased gradually from a high of 14.1% in March 2023 to 2.6% in 
December 2024. In April 2025, the reference value was 2.8%, calculated as the average of the 12-
month average inflation rates in Ireland, Finland and Italy plus 1.5 percentage points. The 
corresponding inflation rate in Bulgaria was 2.7%, below the reference value. The 12-month 
average inflation rate in Bulgaria is projected to increase above the projected reference value by 
the end of 2025, fall back to the reference value in the first months of 2026 and stay below it for 
the rest of 2026 (23). A review of a broad range of indicators does not identify causes for concern 
regarding the sustainability of price stability.  
2.2.2. Recent inflation developments 
The annual HICP inflation rate started to decline from 14.3% in January 2023 and flattened 
around 2.8% in May-July 2024 before declining further to 2.1% in October-December 2024. It 
then rose sharply at the beginning of 2025, peaking at 4% in March, before decreasing to 2.8% in 
April 2025. At the beginning of 2023, headline HICP inflation was still above HICP inflation 
excluding energy and food (core inflation), due to higher energy and food price inflation. With the 
rapid disinflation of fuel and gas prices in 2023, overall inflation remained below core inflation in 
the rest of 2023. In 2024, headline HICP inflation and core inflation remained close to each other, 
as the fall in fuel prices in the second half of 2024 was largely offset by somewhat higher food 
price inflation. The sharp price hikes at the beginning of 2025 concerned items both within and 
outside the core inflation basket. These price hikes were largely due to restored higher VAT rates 
for bread and restaurants, higher excise duties for tobacco, increased electricity and gas prices for 
households, other utilities and administered prices, and higher food prices due to increased 
international food prices. The drop in April 2025 of the annual HICP inflation rate was largely due 
to a substantial reduction in hospital fees. Decreases in other administered prices and in gas and 
fuel prices also contributed to the drop. Inflation in Bulgaria has been reconverging with that of the 
euro area over the past 2 years. The average annual inflation rate in Bulgaria was 8.6% in 2023, 
3.2 percentage points above the euro area. It then declined to 2.6% in 2024, narrowing the gap to 
0.2 percentage point. 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food declined from 11.1% in January 2023 to 3% in the May-
August 2024 period, decelerated further to 2.5% in December 2024. It then increased to 3.8% in 
(23) The Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast does not include the impact of lower fees for hospital services and 
of decreases in other administered prices on inflation in April 2025. When taking into account these measures, the
average inflation rate in Bulgaria would likely be close to the reference value by the end of 2025.

March 2025, before declining to 2.3% in April 2025. In 2023, services price inflation remained on 
average 1 percentage point above non-energy industrial goods inflation while both components 
were on a declining path. Services inflation reached 3% in April 2024. It then increased, mainly due 
to tourism and transport services, and stabilised around 5% in the second half of 2024. Since mid-
2024, annual inflation in prices of packaged international holidays picked up to around 15%, as 
VAT rates were restored. Apart from these items, services inflation in 2024 was driven by price 
increases in catering and accommodation services. Services inflation then rose to 7.2% in March 
2025 and then fell to 3.5% in April 2025. Higher administrative and other fees, prices in 
restaurants, and prices of communication services accounted for around 1.5 percentage points of 
the acceleration in services price inflation between December 2024 and March 2025. In April, 
hospital fees were reduced from 5,8 BGN to 1 BGN, that led to 2.9 percentage points decline in 
annual services inflation. Other administered prices also contributed negatively to services inflation 
in April 2025. Annual inflation in non-energy industrial goods prices continued to abate throughout 
2024, and remained around zero in the September 2024 – March 2025 period, benefiting from low 
inflation in imported goods. Inflation in non-energy industrial goods then increased to 0.9% in April 
2025 due to a base effect from the decision to reduce co-payments for certain medicines from 
April 2024.  
2.2.3. Underlying factors and sustainability of inflation 
Macroeconomic policy mix and growth developments 
Economic growth accelerated from 1.9% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024, driven by private consumption. 
In a context of a tight labour market and falling inflation, real wages continued to expand in 2024. 
The continued growth in aggregate employment, as well as increased social transfers underpinned 
strong nominal income expansion in 2023 and 2024. Combined with abating inflation, this led to 
robust growth in real disposable income, which fuelled private consumption. The strong growth in 
consumer credit also supported private consumption in 2023 and 2024. 
Goods exports contracted in 2023, due to the decline in external demand, the strong negative base 
effect from 2022 and some one-off factors (24). In 2024, exports of goods and services contracted 
both in nominal and in real terms, while the terms of trade deteriorated. The decline in exports was 
broad-based in terms of product categories, with somewhat deeper decline in cereals due to weak 
harvest, but more concentrated geographically with sharp declines in a few destination countries. 
The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the economic difficulties in other countries 
have weighed on goods export.  
Services exports expanded robustly in 2023, benefiting from the continued recovery in the tourism 
sector and the expansion of services outsourced to Bulgaria. While these positive trends continued 
(24) Notably planned maintenance in the steel industry and the nuclear power plant and the ban on exports of petroleum
products processed from Russian oil.

in 2024, the volume of international transport services temporarily declined. Overall, in 2024 
services exports contracted by 0.6% in real terms. 
Investment held up well in 2023, increasing by 10.2% with an important contribution from public 
sector investment and purchases of new equipment. In 2024, investment declined by 1.1% due to 
lower public spending and roughly constant private sector borrowing. The accumulation of 
inventories turned sharply negative in 2023. Firms accumulated more inventories in the form of 
unfinished production and final goods in 2024, in parallel with the increase in imports and decline 
in finished construction.  
In 2023, imports contracted sharply, following the decline in exports and inventories and then 
expanded in 2024, reflecting the buoyant private consumption growth. 
Real GDP growth is forecast to slow down to 2% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026 due to both external 
and domestic factors. Private consumption is set to grow more moderately, as lower real 
disposable income growth and precautionary savings constrain purchases by households. The 
outlook for exports has also been revised downwards but is expected to accelerate moderately in 
2026. In addition to subdued external demand, exports of goods in 2025 are affected by planned 
maintenance works in the steel production and oil refining industries. Private investment is 
projected to contract in 2025 and 2026 due to the heightened economic uncertainty. The assumed 
acceleration in EU funds absorption is expected to support moderate investment growth that 
accelerates in 2026. Wage moderation in the private sector is expected to continue, accompanied 
by limited job losses, related to the worsened economic environment and the need to preserve 
competitiveness and profitability among firms. Public sector wages are projected to grow strongly 
in 2025, amid strong hiring in both years. 
Bulgaria’s fiscal stance (25) is estimated to have been broadly neutral in 2024 and, based on the 
Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast, the stance is expected to become supportive in 
2025 (-1.1 of GDP). It is projected to turn contractionary in 2026 (0.8% of GDP). 
The BNB pursues its primary objective of price stability through an exchange rate anchor in the 
context of the currency board with the lev pegged to the euro. The currency board serves as a key 
macroeconomic policy anchor. The monetary tightening in the euro area has affected the
nonfinancial corporations lending segment of the Bulgarian banking sector by increased interest rates, 
but the pass-through to the mortgage lending segment has been rather muted. Country-specific 
factors in the setting of interest rates, high domestic liquidity and competition in the sector explain 
the continued strong lending for house purchases. The deposit base continued to grow due to 
growing disposable income and as households prioritise liquidity and remain risk averse, while 
awareness of alternative investment options remains weak in a context of low financial literacy. 
The ample liquidity in the banking sector provided cheap and abundant funding for credit 
expansion. Moreover, mortgage lending interest rates are predominantly linked to the domestic 
deposit interest rates, which has contributed to keeping down the lending rates, against a backdrop 
of strong competition among leading banks. In 2024, with the easing of inflation and monetary 
conditions in the euro area, the practice of Bulgarian banks seeking temporarily higher returns 
from arbitrage on financial markets abroad instead of expanding domestic market shares, appears 
to have declined. 
Given the risks to the debt-servicing capacity of borrowers, and the quality of banks’ assets, the 
BNB reconfirmed the systemic risk buffer at 3% on 11 December 2023. Moreover, the BNB’s 
Governing Council increased the minimum required reserves on the funds attracted from
nonresidents from 5% to 10% as from 1 June 2023. The minimum required reserves on the funds 
attracted from both residents and non-residents were increased from 10% to 12% as from 1 July 
(25) The fiscal stance is measured as the change in primary expenditure (net of discretionary revenue measures), excluding
COVID-19-related temporary emergency measures but including expenditure financed by non-repayable support
(grants) from the Recovery and Resilience Facility and other EU funds, relative to medium-term potential growth. A
negative (positive) sign of the indicator corresponds to an excess (shortfall) of primary expenditure growth compared
with medium-term economic growth, indicating an expansionary (contractionary) fiscal policy.

2023. The increased reserve requirements were motivated by high inflation, high consumer 
demand, dynamic credit activity, and slow and weak transmission from the monetary tightening in 
the euro area to the domestic financial market. As of October 2024, the BNB imposed
borrowerbased limits to commercial banks in the form of a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85%, a limit of 
debt service to disposable income of 50% and maximum maturity of 30 years. The measures 
appear targeted at the low-income higher-risk borrowers that would be the first and hardest-hit by 
adverse economic conditions. 
Wages and labour costs 
The labour market remained tight in 2023 and 
2024, with the unemployment rate fluctuating 
between 4% and 4.5%, amid increasing 
participation rates and employment rates. 
Compensation per employee grew nominally by 
13.4% in 2023 and by 10.4% in 2024. 
Throughout 2024 wage growth slowed from 
13.8% in Q1 2024 to 4% in Q4 2024 and the 
number of employees in manufacturing declined, 
as inflation pressures subsided and firms aimed 
to improve their competitive position given 
weakened external demand. 
Given the relatively low-income levels in Bulgaria, 
the setting of the minimum wage has an 
important effect both on income inequality and 
on labour market outcomes, such as participation 
rates and regional disparities. The minimum wage was increased by 9.9% at the beginning of 
2023, still below the accumulated inflation since the previous update on 1 January 2021. As from 
1 January 2024 the minimum wage was increased by 19.6%, to BGN 933 (EUR 477), following an 
amendment to the Labour Code aligned with Directive (EU) 2022/2041 on adequate minimum 
wages. Accordingly, the minimum wage in 2024 has to amount to 50% of the average wage in the 
July 2022 - June 2023 period. The same rule led to a further increase in the minimum wage by 
15% in January 2025. Aggregate labour productivity improved by 0.9% in 2023 and by 1.7% in

2024, reflecting the stronger output expansion and some employment gains. Overall, unit labour 
costs (ULC) increased by 12.3% in 2023 and 8.5% in 2024.  
The aggregate ULC dynamics in 2023 and 2024 conceal important sectoral developments. In 
2023, wage growth in manufacturing accelerated to 23% in Q1 2023 (possibly reflecting the 
strong productivity gains in 2022) and then decelerated to 14% in Q4 2023 as firms tried to gain 
competitiveness in export markets. In 2024, manufacturing firms optimised production costs 
through labour shedding to accommodate the sizeable wage increases that reached almost 24% 
on aggregate in the sector. Wages in key service sectors (e.g. trade, transport and hospitality) have 
been growing much more moderately, especially in 2024. In the other services sectors, buoyant 
domestic demand led to intensified hiring and strong wage increases. Consequently, domestic cost 
pressures in services with low productivity gains contributed to higher value added deflators in 
these sectors. Wage increases in the public sector were also an important factor in the strong 
aggregate wage dynamics in 2023 and 2024. 
External factors 
Import prices are an important channel through which external price shocks affect the domestic 
price dynamics. The import deflator turned negative in 2023 and was almost constant in 2024. The 
disinflation process abroad has affected consumer prices directly via imported consumer goods 
and indirectly through prices of raw materials, etc.  
The lev’s real effective exchange rate, which is determined by the price of the lev vis-à-vis the 
currencies of 37 major trade partners, appreciated by 2.5% in 2023 and 1.1% in 2024. The 
appreciation in 2023 was strongly influenced by the depreciation of the Turkish lira against the 
euro. Türkiye is Bulgaria’s most important trading partner outside the EU, accounting for 5.6% of 
total exports and 8.2% of total imports in 2023. In 2024, the appreciation of the Bulgarian lev was 
close to the long-term average and is explained by the higher domestic inflation compared to that 
of the major trading partners. 
Administered prices and taxes 
The share of administered prices in the HICP basket in 2025 is slightly higher at around 15%, 
compared with 12% in the euro area. Prices of electricity and water were increased substantially in 
2023 and 2024 by the regulator. Electricity prices were subsequently increased by 8.4% in January 
2025. Heat energy prices were also increased in 2023, and were subsequently decreased in 2024, 
broadly following price developments for natural gas. The decision to reduce co-payments for 
certain medicines in late March 2024 has also brought down the administered prices since April 
2024. Overall, annual administered price inflation remained on average 1.9 percentage points 
above headline HICP inflation in the November 2023-March 2025 period and then fell 2.7 
percentage points below overall HICP inflation in April 2025. 
Indirect taxes had a slight negative effect on inflation in 2023 and a positive effect in 2024 and at 
the beginning of 2025. The energy measures (lower VAT rates for natural gas and central heating 
and exemption of excise duties for gas and electricity) expired only in mid-2023. As a result, HICP 
inflation at constant tax rates was above headline HICP inflation in 2023. In 2023 and 2024, 
excise duties on cigars and cigarettes were increased cumulatively by almost 10%. Combined with 
the full effect from the abolition of energy support measures in mid-2023, these changes led to a 
negative gap between HICP inflation at constant tax rates and headline HICP inflation in 2024. This 
gap widened at the beginning of 2025, following the expiration of VAT decreases for bread, flour 
and restaurants and the increase in excise duties on tobacco products by 6% (26). Another increase 
of the excise duties on tobacco products of around 4% was introduced in May 2025. In the euro 
area, annual constant-tax HICP was below headline inflation by 0.1 percentage point in 2023 and 
by 0.5 percentage point in 2024.   
(26) VAT rates of 20% were restored, after the expiration of the 0% VAT on bread and flour and the 9% on restaurants,
introduced in mid-2020.

A comparison between the HICP index and Eurostat’s measure of HICP at constant tax rates shows 
that the changes in indirect taxes in Bulgaria in January 2025 contributed directly to an increase in 
Bulgaria’s month-on-month headline inflation in January 2025 by around 0.6 percentage point. 
This, together with the impact from higher regulated electricity and gas prices, which is estimated 
at around 0.4 percentage point, drives the forecast increase in annual inflation throughout the 
current year. 
Medium-term prospects 
The Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast projects that average annual inflation will 
increase from 2.6% in 2024 to 3.6% in 2025 and gradually ease to 1.8% in 2026. After the price 
increases in Q1 2025, as discussed in Section 2.2.2., and the reduction in April 2025, inflation 
developments in the rest of 2025 and in 2026 are set to be driven by both external prices and 
domestic cost factors. Food prices are projected to broadly follow international developments. The 
pass-through of lower international energy and other commodities prices is projected to keep 
inflation down, including via second-round effects on transport services. The disinflation process in 
the services sector is set to benefit from the continuation of wage moderation and the need to 
preserve the competitiveness position in exported services in a context of a worsened external 
environment.  
Increased inflation in 2023 has brought the consumer price level in Bulgaria closer to the euro 
area average. The level of consumer prices in Bulgaria nevertheless stood at about 57% of the 
euro area average in 2023. This suggests that there is potential for price level convergence in the 
long term, as GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power standards (about 61% of the euro area 
average in 2023) rises towards the euro area average. 
Medium-term inflation prospects will depend on the containment of price expectations and on 
wage-productivity developments, as well as on the functioning of product and services markets. 
These developments may be substantially affected by the cyclical position of the economy. 
2.3. PUBLIC FINANCES 
2.3.1. Recent fiscal developments 
The Bulgarian deficit has remained within the 3% of GDP Treaty reference value since 2022. 
However, after decreasing to 2.0% in 2023, the deficit returned to 3.0% in 2024. The
expenditureto-GDP ratio increased from 38.8% to 39.8% whereas the revenue-to-GDP ratio in 2024 remained 
broadly stable at 36.7% from 36.8%, also due to higher social security contributions and direct 
taxes, which benefited from favourable employment dynamics.  
In 2023, changes in income policy parameters such as the minimum and maximum insurable 
income drove social contributions up. Revenues were further supported by the introduction of a 
100% dividend policy on SOEs. Increases in public sector salaries and pensions that had been 
enacted in previous years started to have a budgetary impact. However, the outturn deficit for 
2023 was also affected by the normalisation of energy prices, which contributed to a sharp 
decrease in subsidies (down by 46.7% from 2022, the equivalent of 2.2% of GDP).  
Declining inflation in 2024 resulted in more moderate revenue increases, while the expenditure 
side continued to grow steadily due to legislative changes from 2022 that continued to have an 
impact in 2024. The deterioration in the deficit was partly driven by the sustained spending 
increases in public sector salaries and in social benefits, in particular on pensions, not fully 
matched by revenue increases. For pensions the main driver was the yearly indexation based on 
the so-called ‘Swiss rule’ (by 12% as of 1 July 2023 and by 11% as of 1 July 2024) and top-ups 
for pensions under the poverty line. Further increases were recorded in sickness and 
unemployment benefits among others. The one-off statistical recording of settled liabilities for 
road infrastructure works from 2020-22 also contributed, by 0.5% of GDP, to the increase in the 
deficit. Public investment decreased compared to 2023, partly due to the base effect in 2023 
coming from the end-of-period absorption of the EU funds of the 2014-2020 programme.

Convergence Report 2025 on Bulgaria - Technical annex 
Chapter 2 - Bulgaria 
33 
Measures on the revenue side included a package of measures to fight tax evasion and avoidance, 
including improved checks on goods with high fiscal risk and improved exchange of information on 
cross-border payments. On the other hand, SOE dividends collected in 2024 were lower than in 
2023, driving down other current revenues.  
The fiscal stance was broadly neutral in 2024, driven by the expansionary contribution of net 
nationally financed primary current expenditure and of other capital expenditure that were largely 
offset by lower nationally financed gross fixed capital formation and the slightly contractionary 
contribution of EU-funded expenditure compared to 2023, which was the last year for the 
absorption of the EU funds for the programming period 2014-2020. 
The debt ratio increased from 22.5% in 2022 to 22.9% in 2023. The primary deficit of 1.4% of 
GDP in 2023 and the impact of nominal GDP growth cancelled each other out, but the joint impact 
of interest expenditure and a positive stock-flow adjustment led to the increase. In 2024, the 
general government debt-to-GDP ratio further increased to 24.1%, mostly driven by a larger 
primary deficit (2.5% of GDP) and interest expenditure, which more than offset the impact of 
robust nominal GDP growth. 
2.3.2. Medium-term prospects 
On 27 February 2025, Bulgaria submitted its national medium-term fiscal structural plan to the 
Council and the Commission, covering the 2025-2028 period.  
The net expenditure growth in the plan averages 4.9% over the 2025-28 adjustment period. In 
terms of structural primary balance, the plan envisages a yearly adjustment of 0.16% of GDP. The 
indicative strategy to meet the fiscal targets included in the plan is heavily reliant on revenue 
measures, and it envisages expenditure increases, notably in public sector salaries, pensions and 
social benefits. 
On 12 May 2025, the Commission recommended to the Council to endorse Bulgaria’s plan. Based 
on the plan’s policy commitments and macroeconomic assumptions, the net expenditure path put 
forward in the plan is consistent with the requirements as set out in Article 16(2) of Regulation 
(EU) 2024/1263. 
The 2025 budget was adopted by the National Assembly on 21 March 2025. On the revenue side, 
it heavily relies on the yields of measures to fight tax evasion and avoidance and on dividend 
policy, but it is also supported by other measures such as planned increases in excise duties on 
tobacco products and by the reinstatement of standard VAT rates including for restaurants, bread 
and flour. A positive impact on the budget is also expected from increases in maximum and 
minimum insurable income, resulting in higher social security contributions, and by improvements 
in arrears management. 
On the expenditure side, the budget for 2025 envisages public sector salaries to grow, in line with 
recent trends, with the largest budgetary impact from increases in the remuneration of defence 
and security staff, followed by salary increases for teachers and increases in the minimum wage. 
Pension spending is expected to increase further, largely due to the impact of the Swiss rule, of 
other pension supplements (for instance widow’s supplements), as well as the impact of
newlyawarded pensions. Public investment is expected to increase considerably in 2025 compared to 
2024, driven by the planned acceleration of RRP implementation, which needs to be completed by 
mid-2026, and also driven by strong increases in defence investment due to the accrual of 
planned deliveries of military equipment. 
On 2 May 2025 Bulgaria submitted its 2025 Annual Progress Report, reporting on relevant fiscal 
outturn data and projections, and the implementation of reforms and investments responding to 
the main challenges identified in the European Semester country-specific recommendations. The 
2025 Annual Progress Report also reflects Bulgaria’s biannual reporting on the progress made in 
delivering on its recovery and resilience plan in accordance with Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 
2021/241.    
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 47 –
European Commission 
Convergence Report 2025 on Bulgaria  
34 
Based on the Commission’s 2025 Spring Economic Forecast, the general government deficit is 
projected at 2.8% of GDP in both 2025 and 2026. Net expenditure is expected to grow by 9.2% in 
2025, above the recommended growth rate of 6.2% for the same year. This is due to the 
combination of expenditure increases on pensions and public sector salaries and of a marked 
increase in expenditure on defence, including investment, as well as to higher public investment in 
other areas. On 2 May Bulgaria submitted a request to activate the National Escape Clause (NEC) 
for increases in its defence spending. On 4 June 2025, the Commission recommended a Council 
recommendation for the activation of the NEC for Bulgaria, allowing Bulgaria to deviate from, and 
exceed, the net expenditure path to be set in the Council recommendation endorsing its
mediumterm fiscal plan. Accounting for the flexibility under the NEC, the net expenditure growth for 2025 
is expected to be in line with the net expenditure growth ceilings contained in Bulgaria’s
mediumterm plan. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase to 25.1% in 2025 and 
to reach 27.1% in 2026. 
Based on the Commission’s estimates, the fiscal 
stance is projected to become expansionary in 
2025, at –1.1% of GDP. The expansionary fiscal 
stance in 2025 is largely driven by EU-financed 
expenditure. The contribution of net nationally 
financed investment is also projected to be 
slightly expansionary (-0.2% of GDP) in 2025. The 
fiscal stance is expected to turn contractionary in 
2026 (0.8% of GDP), mainly on account of the 
slower growth in nationally financed primary 
current expenditure and nationally financed 
investment. 
Medium-term fiscal sustainability risks are

assessed as medium. Government debt is projected to increase from 24.5% of GDP in 2024 to 
around 39% in 2035 (27). This projection assumes that the structural primary deficit (prior to 
accounting for expected changes in the cost of ageing) will remain constant at 2.3% of GDP as of 
2025 (28). 
The sensitivity analysis confirms this risk assessment since negative macro-fiscal shocks (i.e. a 
lower structural primary balance, a higher interest-growth rate differential or a temporary interest 
rate shock) would result in only somewhat higher debt ratios by 2035. On the other hand, if the 
structural primary balance were to return to its historical 15-year average of 0.6% of GDP, the 
debt ratio would be about 14 percentage points lower in 2035. The stochastic projections point to 
a large degree of uncertainty around the baseline projection. 
Several factors mitigate risks, including the low share of short-term government debt and the 
small amount of general government contingent liabilities. Risk-increasing factors include the 
relatively high share of non-performing loans in the Bulgarian banking sector and the substantial 
share of public debt denominated in euro although this risk is mitigated by the currency board and 
the prospect for euro adoption. 
The key elements of a robust fiscal framework are in place in Bulgaria, but some difficulties in 
implementation remain. Bulgaria has a complex system of national fiscal rules in place, unchanged 
since the 2024 Convergence Report. Several rules target the same budget aggregates but the fact 
that they are expressed according to different accounting standards (accrual and cash-based) may 
create conflicting messages. Moreover, the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to monitor, plan, 
forecast and report on the general government budget in both accrual and cash terms remains a 
challenge, especially with respect to the management and planning of government finances. The 
Ministry does not always have as much information or access to detailed data as would be 
desirable for budgetary planning. Information is lacking on the operations of entities outside the 
central administration and occasionally even of some other ministries. The Ministry of Finance also 
has weaknesses in producing projections on an accrual basis (e.g. under the European System of 
National and Regional Accounts (ESA)).  
There is potential to enhance the capacity and independence of the Bulgarian independent fiscal 
institution (IFI), the Fiscal Council of Bulgaria (FCB). It currently has a narrow mandate, monitoring 
compliance of fiscal rules and assessing the macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts and is 
supported by a thinly staffed Secretariat of only two full-time employees. The six-year mandates 
of Members are not staggered, increasing the need for transparency in the appointment process. 
The mandates of the current Members expired in November 2021 and new Members were 
appointed in March 2025. The amended Budgetary Framework Directive (2011/85/EU) which is to 
be transposed by 31 December 2025, will affect some aspects of the Bulgarian fiscal framework, 
particularly relating to the Fiscal Council’s independence safeguards and tasks. 
The planning and budgeting of public investments is undergoing reform, but implementation 
challenges remain. Bulgaria shows scope for improvement on key dimensions such as (i) aligning 
investment decisions with their long-term strategic goals; (ii) vertical (between levels of 
government) and horizontal (across sectors) coordination; (iii) the application of consistent
valuefor-money criteria and methodologies to investments not financed by EU-funds; (iv) limiting the 
under-execution of capital expenditure; and (v) the carry-over of unspent funds. 
2.4. EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY 
The Bulgarian lev joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II) on 10 July 2020. The Bulgarian 
National Bank (BNB) entered in parallel into a ‘close cooperation’ agreement with the ECB. After 
(27) For more details on the methodology, see European Commission (2025), Debt Sustainability Monitor 2024, Institutional
Paper 306, March 2025.
(28) Bulgaria’s medium-term plan implies that debt would reach around 41% of GDP in 2035, broadly similar to the
baseline projection at unchanged policy in the Debt Sustainability Monitor 2024.
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 49 –

Convergence Report 2025 on Bulgaria

joining, Bulgaria committed to pursue a set of policy measures (known as post-entry 
commitments) to ensure that its participation in the mechanism is sustainable and achieves a high 
degree of economic convergence before the adoption of the euro. The measures cover four policy 
areas: (i) the non-banking financial sector; (ii) the insolvency framework; (iii) the anti-money 
laundering framework; (iv) and governance of state-owned enterprises.  
Bulgaria introduced its currency board framework on 1 July 1997, pegging the Bulgarian lev to the 
German mark and subsequently to the euro (at an exchange rate of 1.95583 BGN/EUR). Under the 
currency board framework, the BNB has to fully cover its monetary liabilities with foreign reserves. 
The BNB is obliged to exchange monetary liabilities and euro at the official exchange rate without 
any limit. 
Bulgaria’s international reserves are large, at 41% of GDP in 2024 (down from around 44% of 
GDP in 2023). International reserves increased from around EUR 38 billion at the beginning of 
2023 to around EUR 42 billion at the end of 2023. The reserves decreased in the first half of 2024 
to around EUR 38 billion and then increased to around EUR 42 billion by the end of 2024. Most of 
the inflows to the reserves in 2023 reflected the issuance of government securities on 
international financial markets. Positive contributions were also made by a net positive flow from 
purchases and sales of reserve currency by commercial banks. In 2024, sales of reserve currency 
by banks had the largest negative contribution to the gross international reserves, while 
Government and other depositors’ funds had a positive contribution.  
The BNB does not set monetary policy interest rates. The euro area’s monetary policy affects 
domestic interest rates directly through the operation of Bulgaria’s currency board. The BNB 
discontinued the production of short-term reference rates (e.g. SOFIBOR) from 1 July 2018. The 
BNB instead publishes a base interest rate (BIR) based on the LEONIA Plus (LEv OverNight Interest 
Average Plus) index, which is a reference rate of concluded and effected overnight deposit 
transactions in Bulgarian lev on the interbank market in Bulgaria. The BIR stood at 1.8% in January 
2023. It increased throughout most of 2023, reaching 3.9% in October 2023 and remained at that 
level until May 2024. It decreased gradually to 2.4% in March 2025. The changes in the BIR closely 
tracked those of the 1-month Euribor rate. The interest rate differential between the BIR and the 
1-month Euribor narrowed from -15 basis points at the beginning of 2023 to virtually no
differential by the end of that year. The interest differential widened slightly throughout 2024 and
stood at 3 basis points in March 2025.
2.5. LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES 
Long-term interest rates used for the convergence examination reflect the secondary market yield 
on a single benchmark Bulgarian government bond with a residual maturity of around 6.5 years.

The Bulgarian 12-month moving average
longterm interest rate relevant for the assessment of the Treaty criterion was below the reference 
value in the 2024 convergence assessment of Bulgaria. The average interest rate increased from 
1.6% in January 2023 to 3.9% at the end of 2024. It stood at 4.0% until September 2024 and 
slightly decreased to 3.9% since then. In April 2025, the reference value, calculated as the average 
of long-term interest rates in Ireland, Finland and Italy plus 2 percentage points, was 5.1%. In that 
month, the 12-month moving average of the yield on the Bulgarian benchmark bond was 3.9%, i.e. 
1.2 percentage points below the reference value. 
The Bulgarian long-term interest rate has been stable at or close to 4% since April 2023, following 
two stepwise increases in February and March 2023. The long-term interest rate increased from 
1.9% in January 2023 to 4.2% in March. Thereafter, it remained unchanged at 4.0% for the rest of 
2023 and at 3.9% throughout 2024 and up to April 2025. The increase in the long-term interest 
rate at the beginning of 2023 reflected the very high inflation that Bulgaria experienced in 2022 
and the tightening of monetary policy in the euro area that year. The stability of the long-term 
interest rate at the higher level is due to the use of a single benchmark bond at any point in time 
for this assessment and the fact that the bond is infrequently traded on the secondary market. 
Financial developments are therefore not seen in the yields until the bond is either traded or 
replaced by a new benchmark bond. The difference between the Bulgarian and German long-term 
interest rates remained within a range of 1.4-1.9% from March 2023 to April 2025. The higher 
spread compared to its historical average of around 1.2% during the past decade likely reflects the 
combined effects of higher inflation, heightened political uncertainty in Bulgaria and the thin 
secondary market for Bulgarian government debt securities. 
2.6. ADDITIONAL FACTORS 
The Treaty (Article 140 TFEU) calls for an examination of other factors relevant to economic 
integration and convergence that the Commission should take into account in its assessment. The 
assessment of the additional factors (including balance of payments developments, and product, 
labour and financial market integration) gives an indication of a Member State’s ability to integrate 
into the euro area without difficulties. 
In December 2024, the Commission published its 14th Alert Mechanism Report (AMR 2025) under 
the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. The report concluded that it was not necessary to carry 
out further in-depth analysis on Bulgaria in the context of the Macroeconomic Imbalance 
Procedure. Developments related to cost competitiveness, dynamic household borrowing, and 
strong house-price growth remain a concern and require continued close monitoring. Nevertheless, 
nominal wage growth has been on a declining path with sharp deceleration in Q4 2024. House 
prices have continued to increase. They have been growing more slowly than income since 2013 
but are estimated to be overvalued by around 10-15%. Household debt remains low as share of 
GDP despite dynamic credit flows that are supported by very low interest rates on mortgages. In 
terms of financial stability, in February 2024, the European Systemic Risk Board concluded that the 
residential real estate market in Bulgaria was subject to medium risks and the macroprudential

policy mix was partially appropriate and partially sufficient to mitigate the situation.
Borrowerbased macroprudential measures were introduced by the Bulgarian National Bank in September 
2024.  
Bulgaria’s recovery and resilience plan (RRP) includes measures to address a series of structural 
challenges by reforming the energy sector, investing in sustainable transport and green transition, 
promoting deployment of 5G networks, strengthening rule of law and the fight against corruption, 
promoting entrepreneurship and e-governance, improving the quality and inclusiveness of 
education and reforming the minimum income scheme. The plan is supported by EUR 5.7 billion of 
RRF funding. 
Bulgaria has implemented 23% of the plan’s milestones and targets and received one 
disbursement of EUR 1.37 billion or 24% of the overall allocation.  
On 16 April 2025, Bulgaria submitted a request to revise its RRP in line with Art. 21 of the RRF 
Regulation. The revision concerns nearly all measures in the RRP and aims to bring the plan back 
on track and deliver on the original plan’s key objectives. Together with its request for revision, 
Bulgaria has submitted a proposal for a REPowerEU chapter.  
Some important reforms in areas such as anti-money laundering, insolvency framework, SOE 
governance reform and education have progressed. Implementing key reforms in the areas of 
energy, business environment and rule of law, is crucial to deliver on the RRP commitments. 
Investments providing support for small and medium enterprises, industrial modernisation and 
healthcare have progressed. However, overall implementation faces significant delays and needs 
to accelerate in order to complete all measures by August 2026.    
In addition, cohesion policy funding helps tackle Bulgaria’s growth and competitiveness challenges 
and aims to reduce the country’s territorial and social disparities. In the current 2021-2027 
programming period, cohesion policy provides Bulgaria with EUR 10.7 billion to further support 
Bulgaria’s competitiveness, green transition, including energy independence, the just transition and 
climate change resilience, as well as upward social convergence, including by addressing labour 
shortages, further developing educational systems and skills and making them more inclusive for 
disadvantaged groups. Bulgaria has made progress in implementing cohesion policy but challenges 
remain. 
2.6.1. Developments in the balance of payments 
Bulgaria’s external balance (i.e. the combined current and capital accounts) turned positive to 0.7% 
in 2023 and deteriorated to -0.1% in 2024. Net services exports improved markedly in 2023 with 
the recovery in tourism exceeding pre-pandemic levels and other services, including those 
outsourced to Bulgaria (e.g. IT and business services). It then slowed down in 2024 largely due to a 
temporary decline in transport services exports to Germany and Greece in Q2 and Q3 2024. The 
trade balance improved in 2023 as imports declined more steeply than exports on account of a 
deep contraction in inventories accumulation and more moderate private consumption. In 2024 
trade balance deteriorated as external demand remained constrained, while imports of goods 
increased on account of stronger domestic demand. The Russian war of aggression continued to 
weigh on the export performance in 2024, with goods exports to the Russian Federation and 
Ukraine contracting by 26% and 38%, respectively, in nominal terms. The terms of trade 
deteriorated in both 2023 and 2024. The primary income deficit widened to 6.6% of GDP and then 
shrank to 5.1% in 2024, driven by the rise and the subsequent decline in foreign direct investment 
(FDI) income. Secondary income balance deteriorated as a share of GDP in 2023 and 2024, while 
capital account balance improved in both years. The developments in the secondary income 
balance were largely determined by the current transfers from the EU to the government, including 
direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy and other non-investment grants. In 2023, 
the capital account balance improved mostly due to lower value of purchases of land abroad by 
residents. In 2024, capital transfers from the EU in the form of investment grants account for 
most of the increase in the capital account balance.

The financial account, net of official reserves, deteriorated to –2.5% of GDP in 2023 and then 
turned slightly positive in 2024. FDI, notably in the form of reinvested earnings, made the largest 
negative contribution to the financial account balance in both years. Net investments in debt 
securities abroad contributed by 1% of GDP and 1.5% of GDP to the financial account in 2023 and 
2024, respectively. The improvement in 2024 is largely attributable to the increased investments 
in long-term debt securities abroad by the banking sector, related to the high domestic liquidity 
and higher returns on foreign financial assets. The balance of other investments had a limited 
impact on the financial account balance, with gross inflows and outflows of currency and deposits 
roughly offsetting each other. The BNB’s reserve assets increased by 3.5% of GDP in 2023 and 
then decreased by 0.9% of GDP in 2024, largely mirroring the developments of the external 
balance and financial account (29). 
The net international investment position further 
improved to –5% of GDP in 2024, having stood at 
over -50% of GDP a decade ago. The 
improvement reflects both nominal GDP growth 
as well as higher growth in foreign assets than in 
liabilities on the back of subdued FDI inflows. 
The real effective exchange rate deflated by the 
HICP appreciated in 2023 and then depreciated in 
2024 as domestic inflation abated. By contrast, 
the real effective exchange rate deflated by unit 
labour costs (ULC) accelerated, as domestic wage 
growth outstripped the wage dynamics abroad. 
With the deterioration of external demand in 
(29) Valuation changes (exchange rate or price changes) of the country’s external assets and liabilities, as well as other
changes, e.g. arising from changes in residence, are not included in the balance of payments.

2023, exporters sharply reduced inventory accumulation and cut purchases from abroad. Wage 
growth also decelerated throughout 2023 and 2024, reflecting firms’ efforts to secure 
competitiveness gains against the backdrop of deteriorated foreign demand. In an environment of 
deteriorating world exports in 2023, Bulgarian export market share improved by 1.8%, driven by 
services exports.

slightly negative at to –1.1% of GDP in 2025 and -1% of GDP 2026 as imports grow faster than 
exports.  
2.6.2. Market integration 
The economy is well integrated with the euro area through trade and investment linkages. After a 
decline between 2019 and 2020, the ratio of trade openness (see Table 2.5 for a definition) 
rebounded to close to 71.2% in 2022, which was a new peak. It decreased to 61.5% in 2023 and 
further to 55.6% in 2024. Bulgaria is a relatively open economy. Trade with the euro area was 
around 25% of total trade in 2024. Germany, Italy and Greece were the main trading partners. 
Outside the euro area, Bulgaria’s main trading partners were Türkiye and Romania. 
Net FDI inflows have remained low, at 5.5% of GDP in 2023 and then declined to 3.1% of GDP in 
2024. Reinvested earnings accounted for most the FDI inflows in those two years, while direct 
investment in equity from abroad contracted in 2024. The low inward FDI since the 2008-09 
global financial crisis reflects low investor appetite and difficulties to attract fresh capital. The 
stock of inward FDI as a share of GDP continued to decline to 62% in 2024, down from 65% in 
2023, due to both low FDI inflows and sustained nominal GDP growth. In 2024, financial and 
insurance, real estate and manufacturing constituted around 60% of the total inward FDI stock, in 
almost equal proportion.

Unsupportive business environment and 
institutional quality remain important challenges. 
According to the World Bank’s 2024 Worldwide 
Governance Indicators, Bulgaria ranks markedly 
lower in rule of law, fight against corruption and 
regulatory quality than the average of the five
euro area Member States with the lowest scores 
(30). Political favouritism has been shown to have 
a strong impact on public tenders and to have 
adverse effects on productivity and 
competitiveness (31). The Bulgarian RRP includes 
several measures to improve the business 
environment. These include ambitious reforms of the judiciary and  anti-corruption reforms 
(including on whistle-blowing), the overhaul of the public procurement framework, the liberalisation 
of the electricity market, and strengthening the frameworks for insolvency, anti-money laundering 
and the governance of state-owned enterprises. The last three are also part of the post-entry 
commitments that Bulgaria made when it entered ERM II. After considerable delays, the 
implementation of several of these RRP reforms is under way and progressing (see also Section 
2.7. on the Sustainability of Convergence). 
Bulgaria has taken action to improve the framework for preventing and fighting money laundering, 
its predicate offences and the financing of terrorism. These actions include amending the Law on 
Measures Against Money Laundering to strengthen the capacity of national anti-money laundering 
and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) supervisory authorities to act where obliged 
entities fail to comply with their obligations and adopting an action plan for countering money 
laundering and terrorism financing (2023-2027) whose implementation is underway. 
Bulgaria has also taken steps to: enhance the accuracy of beneficial ownership information 
through a mechanism for the reporting of discrepancies; reinforce the analytical capacity of the 
Financial Intelligence Unit to make better use of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) through the 
implementation of new IT software for the submission of STRs and other reports and information 
which became operational in March 2024; communicate swiftly targeted financial sanctions 
adopted and amended by the UN Security Council; and to identify the subset of non-profit 
organisations which are likely to be at risk of abuse for terrorist financing. Bulgaria underwent an 
assessment of the effectiveness of its AML/CFT framework against international standards 
developed by the Financial Action Task Force. As a result, Bulgaria was placed under increased 
monitoring and adopted an action plan, in October 2023 to address the deficiencies. The Bulgarian 
authorities are in the process of implementing the action plan. 
The education system faces serious difficulties to ensure quality and inclusiveness. Around half of 
15-year-old students lack basic numerical and reading competences according to the Programme
for International Student Assessment. Socio-economic background has a major impact on students’
performance, with children from disadvantaged groups performing considerably worse. To tackle
some of these challenges, the Bulgarian RRP supports the creation of STEM learning centres, which
is ongoing. The lack of basic skills translates to significantly fewer students entering higher
education than the EU average, while quality standards for admission are lower.
Labour and skills shortages remain a significant challenge and risk worsening, considering the 
educational attainment and negative demographic trends. This in turn, combined with the high 
(30) A Member State is considered to have a ‘low’ (‘high’) ranking compared with the average five euro area Member States
with the lowest scores for each indicator if its score is at least 0.3 percentage point lower (higher) than that of the
average of this group of five euro area Member States. See also European Commission, 2024 Rule of Law Report,

inactivity rates for Roma and persons with disability, poses challenges for economic growth and 
social outcomes.  
Bulgaria also scores low on digital skills and the update of digital technologies. Only 35.5% of 
Bulgaria’s population has basic digital skills, which is among the lowest rates in the EU. Bulgaria 
scores very low on the digitalisation of businesses, with small and medium enterprises particularly 
affected. One of the priorities of both Bulgaria’s RRP and Cohesion policy investments is to improve 
digital skills with significant investment to adapt the skill set of the workforce. Moreover, the RRP 
includes measures such as a voucher scheme for the digitalisation of small and medium sized 
enterprises and is complemented by targeted Cohesion Policy investments. 
Public and private R&D investments remain amongst the lowest in the EU as share of GDP. The 
public research landscape is very fragmented with many educational institutions and research 
organisations receiving limited funding. Linkages between academia and business are not
wellestablished and make commercialisation of research results difficult. 
Regional disparities in Bulgaria remain high. GDP per capita in the capital Sofia is around three 
times higher than in the other regions. Similar differences are observed in labour productivity, 
demographics, education and training, employment, healthcare and infrastructure. In addition, the 
lower administrative capacity in some regions further impairs their ability to organise 
procurements, implement investments and to deliver public services and policies Addressing 
territorial disparities is one of the high-level objectives laid down in the Bulgaria’s 2021-2027 
Partnership Agreement. 
Bulgaria’s financial sector is smaller and less developed than the euro area’s. The assets of the 
financial sector amounted to 169% of GDP in 2023, which was much less than in the euro area 
(698% of GDP) but broadly similar to the average of the five euro area Member States with the 
smallest financial sectors. As in the euro area, the size of the financial sector as a share of GDP 
has shrunk in Bulgaria since 2019. Banking dominates the Bulgarian financial sector, making up 
55% of the financial sector’s assets in 2023. The BNB is the second largest holder of financial 
assets with a share of 26% in 2023, more than all non-banking financial intermediaries taken 
together. These shares are larger than in the euro area, reflecting a relative underdevelopment of

non-bank financial intermediaries and investment funds, similar to that of the five euro area 
Member States with the smallest financial sectors. At the same time, the relative share of the 
insurance and pension-fund sector in Bulgaria is similar to that in the euro area. 
As to the financing of the economy, outstanding liabilities are much lower than in the euro area 
(345% of GDP in 2023 vs 725% of GDP in the euro area) but higher than those of the euro area 
Member States with the lowest financing needs. As in the euro area, loans are the dominant source 
of funding. However, Bulgaria has less developed bond and equity markets than the euro area and 
market financing (debt securities and listed shares) is relatively underdeveloped. Equity and 
private-sector-debt markets represented 2% of liabilities in 2023 (and only 11% of GDP 
altogether), compared with 19% of liabilities in the euro area (where private-sector debt and listed 
stocks amounted to 72% and 65% of GDP respectively). Bulgaria’s financing structure is broadly 
similar to that of the five euro area Member States with the smallest financial needs, except for 
the smaller size of its bond market. The latter mostly reflects the low level of public debt in the 
country. Trade credits and advances play a bigger role in the financing of the economy in Bulgaria 
than in the euro area, even when compared with the five euro area Member States with the lowest 
financing needs.

Bulgaria’s banking sector is well integrated into 
the euro area’s financial sector, in particular 
through a high level of foreign ownership in the 
banking system. The ratio of foreign-owned 
institutions to total bank assets was 73% in 
2023, down from 78% in 2019. Bank 
concentration (as measured by the market share 
of the five largest credit institutions in total 
assets) has increased significantly since 2019 
and reached almost 77% in 2023. This is 
27 percentage points above the euro area 
average in 2023.  
2.7. SUSTAINABILITY OF CONVERGENCE 
This concluding section draws together elements that are key for gauging the sustainability of 
Bulgaria’s convergence with the euro area. The analysis reviews sustainability from a number of 
angles. 
First, the sustainability dimension is inherent in the individual convergence criteria themselves. This 
holds most explicitly for the price stability criterion, which includes the requirement of a 
’sustainable price performance’. In principle, the fiscal criterion (EDP) also involves a
forwardlooking aspect, providing a view on the durability of the correction of fiscal imbalances. While the 
exchange and interest rate criteria are, by construction, backward-looking, they aim to capture an 
economy’s ability to operate durably under conditions of macroeconomic stability, indicating 
whether the conditions for sustainable convergence following euro adoption are in place.  
Second, the assessment of additional factors (balance of payments, product and financial market 
integration) required by the Treaty broadens the view on sustainability of convergence and allows 
for a more complete picture, complementing the quantitative criteria. In particular, a sound 
external competitiveness position, effectively functioning markets for goods and services and a 
robust financial system are key to ensuring that the convergence process remains smooth and 
sustainable.  
Third, the convergence assessment should be informed by the results and findings of enhanced 
policy co-ordination and surveillance procedures (MIP, fiscal governance), taking into account the 
comprehensive reform of the EU’s economic governance rules in 2024. The aim is not to add to the 
existing requirements for euro adoption, but to make full use of the comprehensive economic and 
financial analysis undertaken under the European Semester. While some elements drawn from the 
European Semester (e.g. related to AMR scoreboard indicators) are included in the relevant 
chapters on convergence above, this section uses this framework more systematically to provide 
an integrated view of the sustainability dimension. 
Any assessment of the sustainability of convergence has limits and must be based on a judgement 
of the likely future development of the economy. In particular, as experience has shown, the 
sustainability and robustness of the convergence process after euro adoption is to a significant 
extent endogenous, i.e. it depends on a Member State’s domestic policy measures after it has 
joined the euro area. Therefore, while the assessment of sustainability is an essential element in 
determining a Member State’s readiness to adopt the euro based on initial conditions and existing 
policy frameworks, the outcome of such an assessment should be seen as a snapshot at a specific 
point in time. The long-term sustainability of the convergence process will also depend on the 
adoption of appropriate policies over time. In this respect, the ongoing surveillance carried out in 
the context of the European Semester will play a major part in ensuring that such policies are 
implemented by the Member State after euro adoption.

The analysis below looks at sustainability from four different perspectives: price stability; fiscal 
performance and governance; structural resilience and growth sustainability; and financial 
resilience. 
Price stability 
The synchronisation of Bulgaria’s business cycle with that of the euro area (see next sub-section) 
tends to keep Bulgaria’s headline and core inflation at levels similar to those of the euro area. 
Bulgaria’s inflation developments were particularly closely aligned with those of the euro area over 
the decade preceding the energy price shock of 2022. On average, between 2011 and 2021, 
Bulgaria’s headline inflation rate averaged 1.1%, which was below the euro area average of 1.3%. 
Core inflation during this period, at 0.4%, was considerably below the euro area average at 1.1%.  
By contrast, between 2022 and 2024, inflation in Bulgaria was significantly higher than in the euro 
area, with an average annual rate of 8.1% compared to 5.4% in the euro area. The de-coupling of 
inflation in Bulgaria and the euro area during these years was mainly due to Bulgaria’s greater 
exposure to the food and energy price shocks. The price hikes in imported energy and other 
materials in 2022 led to a surge in production costs, thereby also contributing to higher prices for 
domestically produced goods and services. The cost-push factor was more pronounced than in the 
euro area because the Bulgarian economy is around three times more energy intensive than the 
euro area and its cyclical position was stronger. As food accounts for a significantly higher share of 
household consumption in Bulgaria, the food price shock had a disproportionately stronger impact 
on headline inflation. Subsequently, the unwinding of the shocks led to a stronger disinflation 
process in Bulgaria compared with the euro area. Headline and core inflation in Bulgaria both fell in 
2024 by around 6 percentage points compared with a drop of 3 and 2.2 percentage points 
respectively in the euro area.  
The pick-up in inflation in Bulgaria in 2025 is of a temporary nature and mainly reflects increases 
in January 2025 in a mix of taxes and administered prices, partially offset by the lowered hospital 
fees in April. This effect is set to lead to higher inflation throughout 2025. As the temporary effect 
of higher taxes and administered prices fades away, annual inflation is forecast to fall steadily 
throughout 2026, leading to a decreasing inflation gap compared to the euro area (see Section 
2.2.3.). Additional evidence on the temporary and not broad-based nature of the increase in 
inflation in 2025 is provided by the median HICP inflation rate (32), which has remained below 
2.5% since the beginning of the year, as well as by price expectations in the Commission’s 
consumer and business surveys, which remain below their long-term averages (33).  
Notwithstanding their recent deceleration, nominal unit labour costs (ULC) in Bulgaria have risen 
strongly historically, with an annual average growth of 6.3% since 2011. This trend increase in ULC 
occurred in both the tradeable and non-tradeable sectors of the economy, with a relatively limited 
difference between manufacturing and the rest of the economy. Nevertheless, the increase in ULC 
has not been associated with a loss in Bulgaria’s export market share, which increased by around 
10% between 2011 and 2013 and has remained broadly steady since then (34). This preservation 
of Bulgaria’s export market share was supported by a mix of margin compression, i.e. reduced 
profits per unit of exports, non-labour cost compression, and improved non-cost competitiveness 
through a gradual shift towards higher value-added and tech-intensive products (35). The growth 
(32) Median inflation is the month-on-month inflation rate of the component whose expenditure weight is in the 50th
percentile of price changes. By omitting outliers (small and large price changes), median inflation provides an
alternative measure of underlying inflation. The value above refers to the unweighted measure of median
inflation.

important implications for price stability, the economy’s adjustment capacity and external 
competitiveness. In this context, it will be important to focus structural policies and reforms on 
productivity growth, including technological upgrades to continue sustainable economic 
convergence without lasting price pressures. 
Bulgaria’s successful integration into the euro area will require the continued careful monitoring of 
inflation pressures, with longer-term inflation prospects contingent on wages growing in line with 
productivity. In this respect, continued high growth in public sector wages constitutes a risk for 
higher aggregate wages in Bulgaria. These factors could weigh on the adjustment potential, cost 
competitiveness and inflation prospects of the economy.  
Structural resilience and growth sustainability 
When assessing Bulgaria’s capacity to function smoothly in the euro area, an important dimension 
is its current degree of cyclical synchronisation with the euro area and risks that that this 
synchronisation may weaken in the future. Such a risk will depend on Bulgaria’s macroeconomic 
vulnerabilities and exposure to economic shocks as well as its capacity to adjust to such shocks.  
Bulgaria’s economic cycle has been closely synchronised with that of the euro area for the past 
two decades, both in terms of the real GDP growth rate and the output gap and it is forecast to 
continue doing so in 2025 and 2026. This cyclical synchronisation is higher than for most other 
non-euro area Member States. To a large extent, it is explained by Bulgaria’s highly open economy, 
its strong integration in the EU single market, and the pegging of the lev to the euro since 1999 in 
the context of the currency board framework. In turn, the latter has been backed by prudent fiscal 
policy and low government debt. Bulgaria’s trade grew strongly from the early 2000s up to its EU 
accession and then throughout its EU membership. More than half of exports and imports of goods 
and services are with the EU, with Germany, Romania, Italy and Greece being the most important 
markets. Türkiye is also an important trading partner.  
As to vulnerabilities and exposure to shocks, Section 2.6. stressed that the Macroeconomic 
Imbalance Procedure did not identify major imbalances in Bulgaria in 2025. In particular, the 
country’s external position appears solid. The external balance (the combined current and capital 
account) has been positive most of the time since 2011 and the net international investment 
position (NIIP) improved substantially from –97% of GDP in 2009 to around -4% of GDP in 2024. 
Moreover, Bulgaria’s NIIP excluding non-defaultable instruments, such as foreign direct investment 
and equity shares, has been positive over recent years and reached 46% of GDP in 2024. Bulgaria 
also enjoys relatively high export diversification, which reduces its exposure to sectoral trade 
shocks. Measures of export diversification such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index put Bulgaria 
among the EU Member States with a high export diversification (36). Nevertheless, two sources of 
external vulnerability should be mentioned. The first is cost competitiveness, which was already 
mentioned in the subsection on inflation. The second relates to the country’s high exposure to 
energy and food prices. As witnessed in recent years, shocks to global energy and food prices have 
a stronger pass-through into domestic inflation than the euro area average. The decarbonisation of 
energy production in Bulgaria, including through higher investment in renewables, would 
strengthen the competitiveness of the Bulgarian economy and reduce its exposure to energy price 
shocks. 
The 2025 MIP also identifies two sources of domestic vulnerability: strong growth in credit to 
households and signs of overvaluation in house prices. Although the household debt-to-GDP ratio 
remains low, at 26% in 2024, credit flows remain high - in 2024, they were equivalent to 21% of 
the debt stock in 2023 - and has stood above the MIP threshold of 14% since 2021. According to 
(36) Herfindahl-Hirschman Market Concentration Index a measure of the dispersion of trade value across an exporter’s
partners. It ranges from 0 for perfect diversification and 1 for perfect concentration (i.e. lower values indicate that
exports are more diversified).

the 2025 Alert Mechanism Report, house prices are estimated to be slightly overvalued by around 
10-15%, with continued strong growth in 2023 and 2024.
Several features of the Bulgarian economy support its capacity to adjust to shocks, including its 
labour market and low public debt. Bulgaria’s adjustment capacity was amply tested during the 
pandemic and energy crises, when the economy faced extraordinary headwinds. The contraction in 
economic activity in 2020 was lower than in the euro area and the recovery in output in 2021 and 
2022 was stronger.  
Bulgaria’s labour market is relatively flexible and efficient and this flexibility should facilitate 
adjustment to changes in economic conditions. Despite unprecedented shocks, the unemployment 
rate has declined by more than 1 percentage point since the COVID-19 crisis and now stands more 
than 2 percentage points below the euro area. However, the Bulgarian labour market also suffers 
from some weaknesses in terms of skills shortages (see Section 2.6.2.) and structurally fast 
growth in wages (see subsection on inflation above). The former requires structural challenges in 
the education system to be addressed and increases in adult training. Another positive feature of 
Bulgaria’s adjustment capacity relates to the level of its public debt. In 2024, the country’s public 
debt amounted to 24% of GDP, the second lowest ratio in the EU. In the medium term, such a low 
level of government debt should provide the fiscal space that is needed in a monetary union in the 
event of adverse shocks. In the shorter term, however, Bulgaria’s fiscal space is constrained by a 
deficit, which remains close to the 3% limit.  
Bulgaria’s adjustment capacity remains hindered by a non-supportive business environment. 
Various reports and indicators by international institutions, such as the World Bank’s Worldwide 
Governance Indicators, IMD’s World Competitiveness Report and OECD’s Product Market Regulation 
(PMR) indicators (37), point to an unfavourable business environment, and low government and 
business efficiency. Businesses in the country report that the most significant hindrances to a 
better business environment are corruption, frequent changes in regulations, bureaucracy, and 
biased public procurement (38). Businesses have also consistently complained about the quality of 
regulatory work (39) and the failure to ensure a level playing field (40). Regulatory barriers remain 
higher in Bulgaria than in comparable countries for lawyers, notaries, architects and civil engineers. 
Improving the business environment would both enhance productivity and improve the capacity of 
firms to respond to shocks.  
In recent years, Bulgaria has implemented several reforms that should support its resilience and 
adjustment capacity. There is, however, substantial scope for further progress in this area. In July 
2019, the country committed to implementing policy measures prior to joining the ERM II in the 
following six policy areas: banking supervision; the macroprudential framework; the supervision of 
the non-banking financial sector; the anti-money laundering framework; the insolvency framework; 
and the governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In June 2020, the Bulgarian authorities 
notified the ERM II parties of the fulfilment of these commitments, which the ECB and the 
Commission assessed as effectively implemented. At the time of its ERM II entry in July 2020, 
Bulgaria committed to implementing further policy measures in the following four areas: i) the 
non-banking financial sector; (ii) insolvency framework; (iii) the anti-money laundering framework; 
and iv) the governance of SOEs.  
Measures implemented in the non-banking financial sector aim to improve supervisory practices 
and the governance and functioning of the insurance sector. Insolvency framework measures 
included: an overhaul of the legislative framework; training programmes for insolvency

practitioners; development of manuals, guidelines and specialised electronic tools; and improved 
data collection and publicity. Regarding anti-money laundering, Bulgaria committed to enhance the 
capacity of supervisors and adopt a risk-based approach to detecting and countering such 
activities. On SOEs, the authorities committed among other elements to improve their governance 
by ensuring competitive procedures for board appointments and regular financial performance 
reporting.   
Bulgaria’s recovery and resilience plan includes an ambitious set of structural reforms and 
investments but has faced delays. Bulgaria made some progress with implementing reforms to 
strengthen the rule of law and improve the overall business environment. It has yet to implement 
major reforms to and investments in the decarbonisation of the energy sector, as well as further 
business environment reforms, notably on anti-corruption. In April 2025, Bulgaria submitted a 
comprehensive revision of its RRP, including a REPowerEU chapter, with a view to bringing the plan 
back on track and achieving its ambitious objectives. Accelerating the implementation of the 
planned investments and reforms would strengthen the resilience of the economy and ensure 
Bulgaria benefits fully from its funding allocation under the recovery and resilience facility. 
Financial resilience 
Bulgaria’s financial sector has shown stability and resilience, particularly since the 2009 
international financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine. The banking sector is by far the largest financial subsector in Bulgaria, 
although it is still small relative to the size of its economy when compared to the EU and euro area 
Member States on average.  
The accession of Bulgaria to the Banking Union in 2020 led to the direct supervision by the ECB of 
5 commercial banks registered in Bulgaria, which hold approximately three quarters of all assets in 
the banking sector.  
The banking sector is well-capitalised and profitable. Bulgaria’s banking sector capital adequacy 
and liquidity ratios have remained at consistently high levels. The tier-1 capital ratio is estimated 
at 22.0% as of December 2024, compared with an EU average of around 17.5%. Bulgaria’s 
banking sector liquidity coverage ratio, at around 240% at end-December 2024 (41), was also well 
above the EU ratio of around 165% (42) and around two-and-a-half times higher than the 
regulatory minimum required level of 100%.  
The banking sector records healthy profits. The sector is expected to have achieved record profits 
in 2024, driven by strong net interest income. The Bulgarian National Bank estimates a return on 
equity (ROE) at the end of December 2024 of around 16.0%. This compares with a return of 10.5% 
in 2024 for EU banks (43). The Bulgarian banking sector has experienced rapid growth in lending 
over the past several years, with a focus on mortgage lending. Low interest rates, abundant 
liquidity in the banking system, rapid income growth and positive consumer sentiment together 
have contributed to the dynamic credit activity. In September 2024, the total amount of loans for 
households grew by 21.3% year on year, while loans to non-financial corporations (NFCs) 
increased by 9.1%. The prolonged period of strong lending activity leads to a possible 
accumulation of credit risks in the banking system’s balance sheet, which in the medium term 
could put some downward pressure on the high levels of profits by Bulgarian banks. However, 
while the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains relatively high, the rapid increase in loan 
volumes has not translated into growing NPLs. The share of non-performing exposures continue to 
decline to historically low levels in all major segments of the banks’ loan portfolio, mostly due to 
write-offs and sales of NPLs. A roadmap on the insolvency framework reform was adopted in

2019 as part of the ERM II prior-commitments to prepare Bulgaria for successful participation in 
ERM II. The ERM II post-entry commitment on insolvency sought to implement the roadmap. To this 
end, the changes to the Bulgarian Commercial Act in 2023 and secondary legislation aim to 
address long-standing shortcomings in Bulgaria’s insolvency and restructuring regime. The 
legislative amendments and measures to implement these are also part of the Bulgarian RRP. In 
recent years, the Bulgarian National Bank has repeatedly increased the countercyclical capital 
buffer rate applicable to domestic credit risk exposures to further strengthen the resilience of the 
banking system and prevent an excessive build-up of risks. The Bulgarian National Bank also 
introduced borrower-based measures targeted at low-income higher-risk borrowers as of October 
2024.  
Bulgaria’s capital market is underdeveloped and does not adequately support financing needs for 
both the government and corporates. Recent initiatives could help increase capital market growth 
by increasing financial literacy and engaging market participants. In April 2023, the Bulgarian 
Ministry of Finance published a report, which included 60 recommended actions, with the objective 
of increasing the availability of investable assets and the level of trust in the Bulgarian capital 
market and ultimately making the use of the capital markets cheaper and more efficient within a 
time horizon of 5 years (44). Over the past few years Bulgaria has been a net lender to the rest of 
the world, partially due to limited domestic investment opportunities, depicted by still underutilised 
and relatively inefficient domestic capital markets. Local private-equity (PE) and venture-capital 
(VC) markets remain too small to meet the financing needs of innovative firms. In addition, VCs in 
Bulgaria focus more on early-stage businesses, which is positive for innovation but may pose 
challenges when scaling start-ups, supressing growth prospects. 
The supervisory framework for Bulgaria’s non-banking financial sector has been significantly 
strengthened both in preparation for the country’s Exchange Rate Mechanism II entry in 2020 and 
since then, in addressing post-ERM II policy commitments. The insurance market, though highly 
concentrated, remains significantly smaller than the EU average, with notable distinctions between 
its life and general insurance segments. The low insurance penetration and steady economic 
growth present promising opportunities for insurers to grow and both life and non-life insurance 
are projected to expand rapidly in the years to come.  
Conclusion 
The broad-based analysis of underlying factors relevant for the sustainability of Bulgaria’s 
convergence suggests that sufficiently robust conditions are in place for the country to be able to 
maintain a sustainable convergence path in the medium term, thus supporting a positive 
assessment. However, significant challenges remain, and policy discipline will need to be 
maintained in a determined manner to fully exploit the benefits of participation in the euro area 
and minimise risks to the convergence path going forward.

Convergence Report, June 2025 3 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
1 Introduction 
This Convergence Report has been prepared following a request for a country 
examination submitted by Bulgaria on 25 February 2025. In producing this report, 
the ECB fulfils its requirement under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union (hereinafter the “Treaty”) to report to the Council of the European 
Union (EU Council) at the request of an EU Member State with a derogation “on the 
progress made by the Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations 
regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union”.1 The same mandate 
has been given to the European Commission, which has also prepared a report, and 
both reports are being submitted to the EU Council in parallel. This report covers only 
Bulgaria: the other Member States with a derogation, i.e. the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden, will be examined in the next regular 
Convergence Report in 2026. Denmark, which has a special status, will not be 
covered in the 2026 report, unless it so requests.2 
In this report, the ECB uses the framework applied in its previous Convergence 
Reports. It examines whether a high degree of sustainable economic convergence 
has been achieved in Bulgaria, whether the national legislation is compatible with the 
Treaties and the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and 
of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the “Statute of the ESCB”), and whether the 
statutory requirements are fulfilled for Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank) to become an integral part of the Eurosystem. 
The examination of the economic convergence process is highly dependent on 
the quality and integrity of the underlying statistics. The compilation and reporting 
of statistics must not be subject to political considerations or interference. EU Member 
States have been invited to consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a 
matter of high priority, to ensure that a proper system of checks and balances is in 
place when these statistics are compiled, and to apply minimum standards in the 
domain of statistics. These standards are of the utmost importance in reinforcing the 
independence, integrity and accountability of the national statistical institutes and in 
helping to support confidence in the quality of government finance statistics (see 
Chapter 5). 
From 4 November 2014 it became mandatory for any EU Member State whose 
derogation is abrogated to join the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) at the

latest on the date on which it adopts the euro.3 At that point, all SSM-related rights 
and obligations start to apply to that country. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance 
that the necessary preparations are made. In particular, the banking system of any 
Member State joining the euro area, and therefore the SSM, is subject to a 
comprehensive assessment.4 Bulgaria is currently the only Member State that 
participates in the SSM under the close cooperation established with the ECB as part 
of the country’s commitment to joining the banking union and the exchange rate 
mechanism (ERM II) simultaneously.5 The close cooperation framework with the 
Bulgarian National Bank entered into force on 1 October 2020, following the fulfilment 
of the necessary supervisory and legislative prerequisites. On that date, the ECB 
assumed responsibility for (i) the direct supervision of the significant institutions in 
Bulgaria, (ii) the common procedures for all supervised entities, and (iii) the oversight 
of less significant institutions, which continue to be supervised by the national 
supervisor. ECB Banking Supervision and the Bulgarian National Bank collaborated 
very closely to ensure the smooth integration of the national competent authority into 
the SSM.6 
This report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the framework used for 
the examination of economic and legal convergence. Chapter 3 contains a country 
summary, which provides the main results of the examination of economic and legal 
convergence in Bulgaria. Chapter 4 examines in more detail the state of economic 
convergence in Bulgaria. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the convergence 
indicators and the statistical methodology used to compile them. Lastly, Chapter 6 
examines the compatibility of the national legislation of Bulgaria, including the statute 
of the Bulgarian National Bank, with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty. 
3 On 4 November 2014 the ECB assumed the tasks conferred on it by Council Regulation (EU) 
No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning 
policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions (OJ L 287, 29.10.2013, p. 63). See 
Article 33(2) of that Regulation.

(SSM Framework Regulation) (ECB/2014/17) (OJ L 141, 14.5.2014, p. 1).

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
2 Framework for analysis 
2.1 Economic convergence 
To examine the state of economic convergence in EU Member States seeking to 
adopt the euro, the ECB makes use of a common framework for analysis. This 
common framework, which has been applied in a consistent manner in all European 
Monetary Institute (EMI) and ECB Convergence Reports, is based, first, on the Treaty 
provisions and their application by the ECB with regard to developments in prices, 
fiscal balances and debt ratios, exchange rates and long-term interest rates, as well as 
in other factors relevant to economic integration and convergence. Second, it is based 
on a range of additional backward and forward-looking economic indicators 
considered to be useful for examining the sustainability of convergence in greater 
detail. Some elements of this framework have been enhanced over time. The 
examination of the Member State concerned based on all these factors also provides 
important information which helps to ensure that its integration into the euro area will 
proceed without major difficulties. Boxes 1 to 5 below outline the legal provisions and 
provide methodological details on the ECB’s application of these provisions. 
This Convergence Report builds on principles set out in previous reports 
published by the ECB in order to ensure continuity and equal treatment. In 
particular, a number of guiding principles are used by the ECB (and prior to that by the 
EMI) in the application of the convergence criteria. First, the individual criteria are 
interpreted and applied in a strict manner. The rationale behind this principle is that the 
main purpose of the criteria is to ensure that only those Member States with economic 
conditions conducive to the maintenance of price stability and the coherence of the 
euro area can participate in it. Second, the convergence criteria constitute a coherent 
and integrated package, and they must all be satisfied. The Treaty lists the criteria on 
an equal footing and does not suggest a hierarchy. Third, the convergence criteria 
have to be met on the basis of actual data rather than forecasts. Fourth, the 
application of the convergence criteria should be consistent, transparent and simple. 
Moreover, when considering compliance with the convergence criteria, sustainability 
is an essential factor, as convergence must be achieved on a lasting basis and not just 
at a given point in time. For this reason, the country examination elaborates on the 
sustainability of convergence. 
In this respect, economic developments in the country concerned are reviewed 
from a backward-looking perspective, covering, in principle, the past ten years. 
This helps to better determine the extent to which current achievements are the result 
of genuine structural adjustments, which in turn should lead to a better assessment of 
the sustainability of economic convergence. 
In addition, and to the extent appropriate, a forward-looking perspective is 
adopted. In this context, particular attention is paid to the fact that the sustainability of 
favourable economic developments hinges critically on appropriate and lasting policy 
responses to existing and future challenges. Strong governance, sound institutions

Convergence Report, June 2025 6 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
and sustainable public finances are also essential for supporting price stability and 
sustainable output growth over the medium to long term. Overall, it is emphasised that 
ensuring the sustainability of economic convergence depends on the achievement of 
a strong starting position, the existence of sound institutions, resilience to shocks and 
the pursuit of appropriate policies after the adoption of the euro. 
The cut-off date for the statistics included in this Convergence Report was 
19 May 2025. The statistical data used in the application of the convergence criteria 
were provided by the European Commission (see Chapter 5 as well as the statistical 
tables and charts), in cooperation with the ECB in the case of exchange rates and 
long-term interest rates. In agreement with the Commission, the reference period for 
both the price stability criterion and the long-term interest rate criterion is from May 
2024 to April 2025. For exchange rates, the reference period is from 20 May 2023 to 
19 May 2025. Historical data on fiscal positions cover the period up to 2024. Account 
is also taken of forecasts from various sources and other information relevant to a 
forward-looking examination of the sustainability of convergence. The Commission’s 
Spring 2025 Economic Forecast and its Alert Mechanism Report 2025, which are also 
taken into account in this report, were released on 19 May 2025 and 17 December 
2024 respectively. This report was adopted by the General Council of the ECB on 
30 May 2025. 
With regard to price developments, the legal provisions and their application by 
the ECB are outlined in Box 1. 
Box 1 
Price developments 
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), first indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the 
achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each 
Member State of the following criterion: 
“the achievement of a high degree of price stability; this will be apparent from a rate of inflation which 
is close to that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”. 
Article 1 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that: 
“The criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union shall mean that a Member State has a price performance that is 
sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the 
examination, that does not exceed by more than 1½ percentage points that of, at most, the three best 
performing Member States in terms of price stability. Inflation shall be measured by means of the 
consumer price index on a comparable basis taking into account differences in national definitions”. 
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In the context of this report, the ECB applies the Treaty provisions as outlined below.

Convergence Report, June 2025 7 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
First, with regard to “an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the 
examination”, the inflation rate has been calculated using the change in the 12-month average of the 
HICP in the reference period from May 2024 to April 2025 compared with the previous 12-month 
average. Inflation has been measured on the basis of the HICP, which was developed for the purpose 
of assessing convergence in terms of price stability on a comparable basis (see Section 5.2). Second, 
the notion of “at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”, which is 
used for the definition of the reference value, has been applied by taking the unweighted arithmetic 
average of the rates of inflation of the three Member States with the lowest average inflation rates 
(excluding outliers). 
It should be noted that the concept of “outlier” has been referred to in previous ECB Convergence 
Reports and in the Convergence Reports of the EMI. In line with those reports, a Member State is 
considered to be an outlier if two conditions are fulfilled: first, its 12-month average inflation rate is 
significantly below the euro area average; and, second, its price developments have been strongly 
affected by exceptional factors. The identification of outliers does not follow a mechanical approach. 
The outlier concept was introduced to deal appropriately with potential significant distortions in the 
inflation developments of individual countries that reduce the representativeness of the inflation rates 
in those countries as a benchmark for convergence. The ECB’s approach to identifying outliers in this 
report is in line with the approach followed in previous ECB Convergence Reports. 
On this basis, for the purposes of this report, the three best performing Member States in terms of 
price stability are Ireland (1.2%), Finland (1.3%) and Italy (1.4%). Adding 1½ percentage points to the 
average of these three rates, the reference value for the price stability criterion is 2.8%. None of these 
three best performing Member States has been identified as a possible outlier for exclusion from the 
calculation of the reference value for price stability. 
The average rate of HICP inflation over the 12-month reference period from May 
2024 to April 2025 is reviewed in light of the country’s economic performance 
over the last ten years in terms of price stability. This allows a more detailed 
examination of the sustainability of price developments in the country under review. 
Attention is paid to the orientation of monetary policy, in particular to whether the focus 
of the monetary authorities has been primarily on achieving and maintaining price 
stability, as well as to the contribution of other areas of economic policy to this 
objective. Moreover, the implications of the macroeconomic environment for the 
achievement of price stability are taken into account. Price developments are 
examined in light of supply and demand conditions, focusing on factors such as unit 
labour costs and import prices. Lastly, trends in other relevant price indices are 
considered. From a forward-looking perspective, a view is provided of prospective 
inflationary developments in the coming years, including forecasts by major 
international organisations and market participants. Moreover, institutional and 
structural aspects relevant to maintaining an environment conducive to price stability 
after adoption of the euro are discussed. 
With regard to fiscal developments, the legal provisions and their application 
by the ECB, together with procedural issues, are outlined in Box 2.

Fiscal developments 
1. Treaty and other legal provisions
Article 140(1), second indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the 
achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each 
Member State of the following criterion: 
“the sustainability of the government financial position; this will be apparent from having achieved a 
government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with 
Article 126(6)”. 
Article 2 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that: 
“The criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) 
of the said Treaty shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of 
a Council decision under Article 126(6) of the said Treaty that an excessive deficit exists”. 
Article 126 sets out the excessive deficit procedure (EDP). In accordance with Article 126(2) and (3), 
the European Commission prepares a report if a Member State does not fulfil the requirements for 
fiscal discipline, in particular if: 
1. the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to GDP exceeds a reference value (defined
in the Protocol on the EDP as 3% of GDP), unless either:
(a) the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close
to the reference value; or, alternatively,
(b) the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio
remains close to the reference value;
2. the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds a reference value (defined in the Protocol on the
EDP as 60% of GDP), unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference
value at a satisfactory pace.
In addition, the report prepared by the Commission must take into account whether the government 
deficit exceeds government investment expenditure and all other relevant factors, including the 
medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member State. The Commission may also 
prepare a report if, notwithstanding the fulfilment of the criteria, it is of the opinion that there is a risk of 
an excessive deficit in a Member State. The Economic and Financial Committee formulates an 
opinion on the Commission’s report. Lastly, in accordance with Article 126(6), the EU Council, on the 
basis of a recommendation from the Commission and having considered any observations which the 
Member State concerned may wish to make, decides, acting by qualified majority and excluding the 
Member State concerned, and following an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists in 
a Member State.

The Treaty provisions under Article 126 are further clarified by Regulation (EC) No 1467/977 as 
amended by Regulations (EU) Nos 1177/20118 and 2024/12649, which, among other things: 
• confirms the equal footing of the debt criterion with the deficit criterion by making the former
operational;
• specifies the conditions under which a ratio of government debt to GDP which exceeds the
reference value shall be considered sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference
value at a satisfactory pace in accordance with Article 126(2)(b) of the Treaty. The reformed EU
fiscal framework modifies the conditions under which a ratio of government debt to GDP that
exceeds the reference value shall be considered sufficiently diminishing and approaching the
reference value at a satisfactory pace in accordance with Article 126(2)(b). Notably, Article 2(2)
of the Regulation provides that the requirement shall be considered fulfilled if the Member State
concerned respects its net expenditure path. The Commission shall prepare a report in
accordance with Article 126(3) of the Treaty when the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds
the reference value, the budgetary position is not close to balance or in surplus, and the
deviations recorded in the control account of the Member State exceed either 0.3 percentage
points of GDP annually or 0.6 percentage points of GDP cumulatively;
• details the relevant factors that the Commission shall take into account when preparing a report
under Article 126(3) of the Treaty. Most importantly, it mentions a series of factors considered
relevant in assessing developments in medium-term economic, budgetary and government debt
positions (see Article 2(3) of the Regulation).
2. Application of Treaty provisions
For the purpose of examining convergence, the ECB expresses its view on fiscal developments. With 
regard to sustainability, the ECB examines key indicators of fiscal developments from 2015 to 2024, 
the outlook and the challenges for general government finances, focusing on the links between deficit 
and debt developments. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s war against 
Ukraine on general government finances, the ECB refers to the Stability and Growth Pact’s general 
escape clause, which was activated from 20 March 2020 until 31 December 2023, i.e. before the 
reform of the Stability and Growth Pact in April 2024, as laid down in Articles 5(1) and 9(1) of 
Regulation (EC) No 1466/9710 for the preventive arm and in Article 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 
1467/97 for the corrective arm. Regarding the impact of unlocking additional flexibility for higher 
defence expenditure, the ECB refers to the Stability and Growth Pact’s national escape clause, which 
was introduced in the reform of April 2024. Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2024/126311 stipulates that 
“following a request from a Member State and on a recommendation by the Commission based on its 
7 Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of 
the excessive deficit procedure (OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 6). 
8 Council Regulation (EU) No 1177/2011 of 8 November 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on 
speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (OJ L 306, 23.11.2011, 
p. 33). 
9 Council Regulation (EU) No 2024/1264 of 29 April 2024 amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on 
speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (OJ L, 2024/1264, 
30.4.2024). 
10 Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary 
positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1). 
11 Regulation (EU) 2024/1263 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2024 on the 
effective coordination of economic policies and on multilateral budgetary surveillance and repealing

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
analysis, the Council may within four weeks of the Commission recommendation adopt a 
recommendation allowing a Member State to deviate from its net expenditure path as set by the 
Council where exceptional circumstances outside the control of the Member State have a major 
impact on the public finances of the Member State concerned, provided that such deviation does not 
endanger fiscal sustainability over the medium term”. The ECB also provides an analysis with regard 
to the effectiveness of national budgetary frameworks, as referred to in Article 2(3)(d) of Regulation 
(EC) No 1467/97 and in Directive 2011/85/EU12. With regard to Article 126 of the Treaty, the ECB, in 
contrast to the Commission, has no formal role in the EDP. Therefore, the ECB report only states 
whether the country is subject to an EDP. 
With regard to the Treaty provision that a debt ratio of above 60% of GDP should be “sufficiently 
diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace”, the ECB examines past and 
future trends in the debt ratio. For Member States in which the debt ratio exceeds the reference value, 
the ECB provides the Commission’s latest assessment as laid down in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 1467/97. 
The examination of fiscal developments is based on data compiled on a national accounts basis, in 
compliance with the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) (see Chapter 5). Most of the 
figures presented in this report were provided by the Commission in April and May 2025, and include 
government financial positions from 2015 to 2024, as well as Commission forecasts for the period 
2025-26. 
With regard to the sustainability of public finances, the outcome in the 
reference year, 2024, is reviewed in light of the performance of the country 
under review over the past ten years. First, the development of the deficit ratio is 
investigated. It is useful to bear in mind that the change in a country’s annual deficit 
ratio is typically influenced by a variety of underlying forces. These influences can be 
divided into “cyclical effects” on the one hand, which reflect the reaction of deficits to 
changes in the economic cycle, and “non-cyclical effects” on the other hand, which are 
often taken to reflect structural or permanent adjustments to fiscal policies. However, 
such non-cyclical effects, as quantified in this report, cannot necessarily be seen as 
entirely reflecting a structural change to fiscal positions, because they include 
temporary effects on the budgetary balance stemming from the impact of both policy 
measures and special factors. 
As a further step, the development of the government debt ratio in this period is 
considered, as well as the factors underlying it. These factors are the difference 
between nominal GDP growth and interest rates, the primary balance and the 
deficit-debt adjustment. Such a perspective can offer further information on the extent 
to which the macroeconomic environment, in particular the combination of growth and 
interest rates, has affected the dynamics of debt. In addition, the structure of 
government debt is considered, focusing in particular on the shares of debt with a 
short-term maturity and foreign currency debt, as well as their development. By 
12 Council Directive 2011/85/EU of 8 November 2011 on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the 
Member States (OJ L 306, 23.11.2011, p. 41). 
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 79 –
 
Convergence Report, June 2025 11 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
comparing these shares with the current level of the debt ratio, the sensitivity of fiscal 
balances to changes in exchange rates and interest rates can be highlighted. 
With the entry into force of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact in 2024 came 
new rules on the opening of a debt-based excessive deficit procedure (EDP). 
While the rules on opening a deficit-based EDP remain largely unchanged, the rules 
on opening a debt-based EDP have been amended as described in Box 2. However, 
over the period up to the cut-off date for statistics in 2025, no debt-based EDPs were 
opened on the basis of the 2024 outcomes given that net expenditure paths, as set by 
the EU Council, cover fiscal strategies only as of 2025. 
The general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact was activated for 
the period 2020-23, and in April 2025 the EU Council initiated a coordinated 
request for activation of the national escape clause. The activation of the general 
escape clause allowed Member States to depart from the budgetary requirements that 
would have normally applied in order to facilitate the necessary policy coordination 
measures in the context of the pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine within the 
framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. On 19 March 2025 the European 
Commission then proposed a coordinated activation of the national escape clause, 
allowing countries to deviate from their endorsed net expenditure path, in order to 
unlock additional budgetary space for higher defence expenditure. In particular, the 
Commission stated that “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and its threat to 
European security are exceptional circumstances outside the control of Member 
States, which have a major impact on Member States’ public finances through the 
related incurred and/or planned increase in defence expenditure”.13 On 30 April 2025 
the Council issued a statement on its coordinated request for activation of the national 
escape clause.14 At that time, 16 Member States had decided to request the activation 
of the clause, which covers a period of four years and a maximum of 1.5% of GDP in 
flexibility. 
Turning to a forward-looking perspective, recent forecasts by the European 
Commission for the period 2025-26 and the assessment of long-term 
challenges to debt sustainability are considered. This includes, in particular, the 
outlook for budget balances and debt ratios on the basis of current fiscal policies. In 
addition, long-term challenges to the sustainability of budgetary positions and broad 
areas for consolidation are emphasised, particularly those related to unfunded 
government pension systems in connection with demographic change and to 
contingent liabilities incurred by government. Under the new rules, countries’ 
medium-term budgetary plans are outlined in their national fiscal-structural plans, 
which they have published since autumn 2024. These plans present a net expenditure 
trajectory covering a period of at least four years and outline government fiscal 
strategies as of 2025.

With regard to exchange rate developments, the legal provisions and their 
application by the ECB are outlined in Box 3. 
Box 3 
Exchange rate developments 
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), third indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the 
achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each 
Member State of the following criterion: 
“the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of 
the European Monetary System, for at least two years, without devaluing against the euro”. 
Article 3 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that: 
“The criterion on participation in the Exchange Rate mechanism of the European Monetary System 
referred to in the third indent of Article 140(1) of the said Treaty shall mean that a Member State has 
respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism on the 
European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the 
examination. In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central 
rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period”. 
2. Application of Treaty provisions
With regard to exchange rate stability, the ECB examines whether the country has participated in 
ERM II (which superseded the ERM as of January 1999) for a period of at least two years prior to the 
convergence examination without severe tensions, in particular without devaluing against the euro. In 
cases of shorter periods of participation, exchange rate developments are described over a two-year 
reference period. 
The examination of exchange rate stability against the euro focuses on the exchange rate being close 
to the ERM II central rate, while also taking into account factors that may have led to an appreciation, 
which is in line with the approach taken in the past. In this respect, the width of the fluctuation band 
within ERM II does not prejudice the examination of the exchange rate stability criterion. 
Moreover, the issue of the absence of “severe tensions” is generally addressed by: (i) examining the 
degree of deviation of exchange rates from the ERM II central rates against the euro; (ii) using 
indicators such as exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis the euro and its trend, as well as short-term 
interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro area and their development; (iii) considering the role 
played by foreign exchange interventions; and (iv) considering the role of international financial 
assistance programmes in stabilising the currency. 
The reference period in this report is from 20 May 2023 to 19 May 2025. The bilateral exchange rates 
referred to are official ECB reference rates (see Chapter 5).

Convergence Report, June 2025 13 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
In addition to ERM II participation and nominal exchange rate developments 
against the euro over the period under review, evidence relevant to the 
sustainability of the current exchange rate is briefly reviewed. This is derived 
from the development of the real effective exchange rates and the current, capital and 
financial accounts of the balance of payments. The evolution of gross external debt 
and the net international investment position over longer periods is also examined. 
The section on exchange rate developments additionally considers measures of the 
degree of a country’s integration with the euro area. This is assessed in terms of both 
external trade integration (exports and imports) and financial integration. Lastly, the 
section on exchange rate developments reports, if applicable, whether the country 
under examination has benefited from central bank liquidity assistance or balance of 
payments support during the two-year reference period. Both actual and 
precautionary assistance are considered. 
With regard to long-term interest rate developments, the legal provisions and 
their application by the ECB are outlined in Box 4. 
Box 4 
Long-term interest rate developments 
1. Treaty provisions
Article 140(1), fourth indent, of the Treaty requires the Convergence Report to examine the 
achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to the fulfilment by each 
Member State of the following criterion: 
“the durability of convergence achieved by the Member State with a derogation and of its participation 
in the exchange-rate mechanism being reflected in the long-term interest-rate levels”. 
Article 4 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria stipulates that: 
“The criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) of 
the said Treaty shall mean that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a 
Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 
two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price 
stability. Interest rates shall be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable 
securities, taking into account differences in national definitions”. 
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In the context of this report, the ECB applies the Treaty provisions as outlined below.
First, with regard to “an average nominal long-term interest rate” observed over “a period of one year 
before the examination”, the long-term interest rate has been calculated as an arithmetic average 
over the latest 12 months for which HICP data were available. The reference period considered in this 
report is from May 2024 to April 2025, in line with the reference period for the price stability criterion. 
Second, the notion of “at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability”, 
which is used for the definition of the reference value, has been applied by using the unweighted 
arithmetic average of the long-term interest rates of the same three Member States included in the 
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 82 –
 
Convergence Report, June 2025 14 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
calculation of the reference value for the criterion on price stability (see Box 1). Over the reference 
period considered in this report, the long-term interest rates of the three Member States with the 
lowest inflation rate included in the calculation of the reference value for the price stability criterion 
were 2.9% (Finland), 2.8% (Ireland) and 3.7% (Italy). As a result, the average rate is 3.1% and, 
adding two percentage points, the reference value is 5.1%.15 
As mentioned above, the Treaty makes explicit reference to the “durability of 
convergence” being reflected in the level of long-term interest rates. Therefore, 
developments over the reference period from May 2024 to April 2025 are reviewed 
against the background of the path of long-term interest rates over the past ten years 
(or the period for which data are available) and the main factors underlying 
differentials vis-à-vis the average long-term interest rate prevailing in the euro area. 
During the reference period, the average euro area long-term interest rate may have 
partly reflected high country-specific risk premia in several euro area countries. 
Therefore, the euro area AAA long-term government bond yield (i.e. the long-term 
yield of the euro area AAA yield curve, which includes the euro area countries with an 
AAA rating) is also used for comparison purposes. As background to this analysis, this 
report also provides information about the size and development of the financial 
market. This is based on three different indicators (the outstanding amount of debt 
securities issued by non-financial corporations, stock market capitalisation and credit 
from monetary financial institutions to the domestic non-financial private sector), which 
together provide a measure of the size of financial markets. 
Lastly, Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires this report to take account of several 
other relevant factors (see Box 5). In this respect, an enhanced economic 
governance framework in accordance with Article 121(6) of the Treaty entered into 
force on 13 December 2011 with the aim of ensuring a closer coordination of 
economic policies and the sustained convergence of EU Member States’ economic 
performances. Box 5 below briefly outlines these legislative provisions and the way in 
which the above-mentioned additional factors are addressed in the assessment of 
convergence conducted by the ECB. 
Box 5 
Other relevant factors 
1. Treaty and other legal provisions
Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires that “The reports of the Commission and the European Central 
Bank shall also take account of the results of the integration of markets, the situation and 
development of the balances of payments on current account and an examination of the development 
of unit labour costs and other price indices”. 
15 Interest rates have been measured on the basis of available harmonised long-term interest rates, which 
were developed for the purpose of examining convergence (see Chapter 5). 
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 83 –
 
Convergence Report, June 2025 15 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
In this respect, the ECB takes into account the legislative package on EU economic governance 
which entered into force on 13 December 2011. Building on the Treaty provisions under Article 
121(6), the European Parliament and the EU Council adopted detailed rules for the multilateral 
surveillance procedure referred to in Article 121(3) and (4) of the Treaty. These rules were adopted “in 
order to ensure closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of the economic 
performances of the Member States” (Article 121(3)) in view of the “need to draw lessons from the 
first decade of functioning of the economic and monetary union and, in particular, for improved 
economic governance in the Union built on stronger national ownership”16. The legislative package 
includes an enhanced surveillance framework (the macroeconomic imbalance procedure or MIP) 
aimed at preventing excessive macroeconomic and macro-financial imbalances by helping diverging 
EU Member States to establish corrective plans before divergence becomes entrenched. 
2. Application of Treaty provisions
In line with past practice, the additional factors referred to in Article 140(1) of the Treaty are reviewed 
in Chapter 4 under the headings of the individual criteria described in Boxes 1 to 4. For completeness, 
Chapter 4 also presents the scoreboard indicators for Bulgaria (including in relation to the alert 
thresholds), thereby ensuring the provision of all available information relevant to the detection of 
macroeconomic and macro-financial imbalances that may be hampering the achievement of a high 
degree of sustainable convergence as stipulated in Article 140(1) of the Treaty. Notably, EU Member 
States with a derogation that are subject to an excessive imbalance procedure can hardly be 
considered as having achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence as stipulated in Article 
140(1) of the Treaty. 
2.2 Compatibility of national legislation with the Treaties 
2.2.1 Introduction 
Article 140(1) of the Treaty requires the ECB (and the European Commission) to 
report, at least once every two years or at the request of a Member State with a 
derogation, to the Council on the progress made by the Member States with a 
derogation in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and 
monetary union. These reports must include an examination of the compatibility of the 
national legislation of each Member State with a derogation, including the statutes of 
its NCB, with Articles 130 and 131 of the Treaty and the relevant Articles of the Statute 
of the ESCB. This Treaty obligation of Member States with a derogation is also 
referred to as “legal convergence”. 
When assessing legal convergence, the ECB is not limited to making a formal 
assessment of the letter of national legislation but may also consider whether the 
16 See recital 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
16 November 2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances (OJ L 306, 
23/11/2011, p. 25). 
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 84 –

implementation of the relevant provisions complies with the spirit of the Treaties and 
the Statute of the ESCB. The ECB is particularly concerned about any signs of 
pressure being put on the decision-making bodies of any Member State’s NCB which 
would be inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty as regards central bank 
independence. 
The ECB also sees the need for the smooth and continuous functioning of the NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies. In this respect, the relevant authorities of a Member State 
have, in particular, the duty to take the necessary measures to ensure the timely 
appointment of a successor if the position of a member of an NCB’s decision-making

The ECB will closely monitor any developments prior to making a positive final 
assessment concluding that a Member State’s national legislation is compatible with 
the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. 
A Member State with a derogation and legal convergence 
Bulgaria, whose national legislation is examined in this report, has the status of a 
Member State with a derogation, i.e. it has not yet adopted the euro. Article 518 of the 
Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania 
and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded provides 
that Bulgaria is to participate in the Economic and Monetary Union from the date of 
accession as a Member State with a derogation within the meaning of Article 139 of 
the Treaty. 
The aim of assessing legal convergence is to facilitate the Council’s decisions as to 
which Member States fulfil “their obligations regarding the achievement of economic 
and monetary union” (Article 140(1) of the Treaty). In the legal domain, such 
conditions refer in particular to central bank independence and to the NCBs’ legal 
integration into the Eurosystem.

Structure of the legal assessment 
The legal assessment broadly follows the framework of the previous reports of the 
ECB and the EMI on legal convergence.19 
The compatibility of national legislation is considered in the light of legislation enacted 
before 15 April 2025. 
2.2.2 Scope of adaptation 
Areas of adaptation 
For the purpose of identifying those areas where national legislation needs to be 
adapted, the following issues are examined: 
• compatibility with provisions on the independence of NCBs, members of NCBs’
decision-making bodies and Governors in the Treaty (Article 130) and the Statute
of the ESCB (Articles 7 and 14.2);
• compatibility with provisions on confidentiality (Article 37 of the Statute of the
ESCB);
• compatibility with the prohibitions on monetary financing (Article 123 of the
Treaty) and privileged access (Article 124 of the Treaty);
• compatibility with the single spelling of the euro required by EU law; and
• legal integration of the NCBs into the Eurosystem (in particular as regards
Articles 12.1 and 14.3 of the Statute of the ESCB).
“Compatibility” versus “harmonisation” 
Article 131 of the Treaty requires national legislation to be “compatible” with the 
Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB; any incompatibility must therefore be remedied.

Neither the primacy of the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB over national 
legislation nor the nature of the incompatibility affects the need to comply with this 
obligation. 
The requirement for national legislation to be “compatible” does not mean that the 
Treaty requires “harmonisation” of the NCBs’ statutes, either with each other or with 
the Statute of the ESCB. National particularities may continue to exist to the extent 
that they do not infringe the competence in monetary matters that is irrevocably 
conferred on the EU. Indeed, Article 14.4 of the Statute of the ESCB permits NCBs to 
perform functions other than those specified in the Statute of the ESCB, to the extent 
that they do not interfere with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.20 Provisions 
authorising such additional functions in NCBs’ statutes are a clear example of 
circumstances in which differences may remain. Rather, the term “compatible” 
indicates that national legislation and the NCBs’ statutes need to be adjusted to 
eliminate inconsistencies with the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB and to ensure 
the necessary degree of integration of the NCBs into the ESCB. In particular, any 
provisions that infringe an NCB’s independence, as defined in the Treaty, and its role 
as an integral part of the ESCB, should be adjusted. It is therefore insufficient to rely 
solely on the primacy of EU law over national legislation to achieve this. 
The obligation in Article 131 of the Treaty only covers incompatibility with the Treaties 
and the Statute of the ESCB. However, national legislation that is incompatible with 
secondary EU legislation relevant for the areas of adaptation examined in this 
Convergence Report should be brought into line with such secondary legislation. The 
primacy of EU law does not affect the obligation to adapt national legislation. This 
general requirement derives not only from Article 131 of the Treaty but also from the 
case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.21 
The Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB do not prescribe the manner in which 
national legislation should be adapted. Compatibility may therefore be achieved by 
removing any national legislation which is incompatible with EU law or by referring to 
the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB, or, exceptionally, by incorporating 
provisions thereof and referring to their provenance, subject to the following 
qualifications: 
As a rule, a reproduction of relevant provisions of Union law directly applicable in the 
legal order of the Member State using the same language is to be avoided.22 A 
reproduction may create uncertainty both as to the legal nature and origin of the 
applicable provisions and as to the date of their entry into force. This would not align 
with the principle of uniform application and interpretation of Union law throughout the 
Union.23 Moreover, if a national provision uses wording that is different from that used 
 
20  As regards tasks and powers that have been partially conferred upon the ECB, any national legislation 
must be without prejudice to the tasks and powers conferred upon the ECB. See Opinion CON/2020/15.

in the relevant Union provision, it creates regulatory content of its own. In accordance 
with Article 2(1) of the Treaty, the Union’s exclusive competence in matters of 
monetary policy precludes Member States from adopting provisions which, in the light 
of their objective and content, establish legal rules governing the use of the euro as the 
single currency, unless Member States have been empowered to do so.24 In this 
context, the concept of monetary policy is not limited to its operational implementation, 
which, under Article 127(2), first indent, of the Treaty is one of the basic tasks of the 
Eurosystem. It also has a regulatory dimension intended to guarantee the status of the 
euro as the single currency.25 
In exceptional circumstances, a reproduction of relevant provisions of Union law 
directly applicable in the legal order of the Member State using the same language 
may be used for the sake of coherence and in order to make them comprehensible to 
the persons to whom they apply. Where such exceptional circumstances allowing for a 
reproduction of directly applicable provisions of Union law exist, provisions should be 
reproduced precisely, and the wording should not be modified.26 Furthermore, 
provisions should be reproduced only to the extent warranted by the exceptional 
circumstances. However, such exceptional circumstances do not exist where the 
directly applicable provisions of Union law are sufficiently coherent and 
comprehensive, making it unnecessary to repeat or reflect them in national law.27 
Where directly applicable provisions of Union law are merely relevant in the context of 
the areas covered by the national law, the national law does not need to reference 
these provisions. To the extent that national law necessarily reproduces directly 
applicable provisions of Union law for the abovementioned reasons, it should do so in 
an explicit manner and clarify that its provisions are either “in accordance with” or “in 
compliance with” the relevant provisions of Union law, where the latter are merely 
reproduced to put the national law in the larger context, or “without prejudice to” the 
relevant provisions of Union law, where a national authority exercises residual 
competences that go beyond those exercised within the ESCB and the Eurosystem.28 
Furthermore, as a tool for achieving and maintaining the compatibility of national 
legislation with the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB must be consulted 
by the EU institutions and by the Member States on draft legislative provisions in its 
fields of competence, pursuant to Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty and Article 4

of the Statute of the ESCB. Council Decision 98/415/EC29 expressly requires Member 
States to take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with this obligation. 
2.2.3 Independence of NCBs 
As far as central bank independence is concerned, national legislation in the Member 
States that joined the EU in 2004, 2007 or 2013 had to be adapted to comply with the 
relevant provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, and be in force on 1 
May 2004, 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2013 respectively.30 Sweden had to bring the 
necessary adaptations into force by the date of establishment of the ESCB on 1 June 
1998. 
Central bank independence 
In November 1995, the EMI established a list of features of central bank independence 
(later described in detail in its 1998 Convergence Report) which were the basis for 
assessing the national legislation of the Member States at that time, in particular the 
NCBs’ statutes. The concept of central bank independence includes various types of 
independence that must be assessed separately, namely: functional, institutional, 
personal, and financial independence. Over the past few years there has been further 
refinement of the analysis of these aspects of central bank independence in the 
opinions adopted by the ECB. These aspects are the basis for assessing the level of 
convergence between the national legislation of the Member States with a derogation 
and the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB. 
Functional independence 
Central bank independence is not an end in itself but is instrumental in achieving an 
objective that should be clearly defined and should prevail over any other objective. 
Functional independence requires each NCB’s primary objective to be stated in a 
clear and legally certain way and to be fully in line with the primary objective of price 
stability established by the Treaty. The pursuit of this objective is served by providing 
the NCBs with the necessary means and instruments for achieving this objective 
independently of any other authority. The Treaty’s requirement of central bank 
independence reflects the generally held view that the primary objective of price 
stability is best served by a fully independent institution with a precise definition of its 
mandate. Central bank independence is fully compatible with holding NCBs 
accountable for their decisions, which is an important aspect of enhancing confidence 
in their independent status. This entails transparency and dialogue with third parties. 
29 Council Decision 98/415/EC of 29 June 1998 on the consultation of the European Central Bank by 
national authorities regarding draft legislative provisions (OJ L 189, 3.7.1998, p. 42).

Convergence Report, June 2025 21 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
As regards timing, the Treaty is not clear about when the NCBs of Member States with 
a derogation must comply with the primary objective of price stability set out in Articles 
127(1) and 282(2) of the Treaty and Article 2 of the Statute of the ESCB. For those 
Member States that joined the EU after the date of the introduction of the euro in the 
EU, it is not clear whether this obligation should run from the date of accession or from 
the date of their adoption of the euro. While Article 127(1) of the Treaty does not apply 
to Member States with a derogation (see Article 139(2)(c) of the Treaty), Article 2 of 
the Statute of the ESCB does apply to such Member States (see Article 42.1 of the 
Statute of the ESCB). The ECB takes the view that the obligation of the NCBs to have 
price stability as their primary objective runs from 1 June 1998 in the case of Sweden, 
and from 1 May 2004, 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2013 for the Member States that 
joined the EU on those dates. This is based on the fact that one of the guiding 
principles of the EU, namely price stability (Article 119 of the Treaty), also applies to 
Member States with a derogation. It is also based on the Treaty objective that all 
Member States should strive for macroeconomic convergence, including price 
stability, which is the intention behind the regular reports of the ECB and the European 
Commission. This conclusion is also based on the underlying rationale of central bank 
independence, which is only justified if the overall objective of price stability has 
primacy. 
The country assessments in this report are based on these conclusions as to the 
timing of the obligation of the NCBs of Member States with a derogation to have price 
stability as their primary objective. 
Institutional independence 
Institutional independence is reflected in Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the 
Statute of the ESCB. These two articles prohibit the NCBs and members of their 
decision-making bodies from seeking or taking instructions from EU institutions or 
bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. In addition, 
they prohibit EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, and the governments of the 
Member States from seeking to influence those members of the NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies whose decisions may affect the fulfilment of the NCBs’ 
ESCB-related tasks. For national legislation to mirror Article 130 of the Treaty and 
Article 7 of the Statute of the ESCB, it should reflect both prohibitions and not narrow 
the scope of their application.31 The recognition that central banks have such 
independence does not have the consequence of exempting them from every rule of 
law or of shielding them from any kind of legislation.32 
Whether an NCB is organised as a state-owned body, a special public law body or 
simply a public limited company, there is a risk that influence may be exerted by the 
owner on its decision-making in relation to ESCB-related tasks by virtue of such

ownership.33 Such influence, whether exercised through shareholders’ rights or 
otherwise, may affect an NCB’s independence and should therefore be limited by law. 
The legal framework for central banking needs to provide a stable and long-term basis 
for a central bank’s functioning. Frequent changes to the institutional set-up of an 
NCB, affecting its organisational or governance stability, could adversely affect that 
NCB’s institutional independence.34 
Institutional independence should also be respected in cases of emergency. Only 
where the conditions under Article 347 of the Treaty are met, may national authorities 
be justified in exercising, on a temporary and exceptional basis, powers that fall within 
the exclusive competence of the ESCB. The critical time for this assessment is when 
the measure is adopted. Due to the exceptional nature of Article 347 of the Treaty, 
Member States should refrain from adopting preventive legislation in the absence of 
the conditions prescribed by Article 347 of the Treaty.35 
Prohibition on giving instructions 
Rights of third parties to give instructions to NCBs, their decision-making bodies or 
their members are incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB as far as 
ESCB-related tasks are concerned. 
Any involvement of an NCB in the application of measures to strengthen financial 
stability must be compatible with the Treaty, i.e. NCBs’ functions must be performed in 
a manner that is fully compatible with their functional, institutional, and financial 
independence so as to safeguard the proper performance of their tasks under the 
Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.36 To the extent that national legislation provides 
for a role of an NCB that goes beyond advisory functions and requires it to assume 
additional tasks, it must be ensured that these tasks will not affect the NCB’s ability to 
carry out its ESCB-related tasks from an operational and financial point of view.37 
Additionally, the inclusion of NCB representatives in collegiate decision-making 
supervisory bodies or other authorities would need to give due consideration to 
safeguards for the personal independence of the members of the NCB’s 
decision-making bodies.38

Prohibition on approving, suspending, annulling or deferring decisions 
Rights of third parties to approve, suspend, annul or defer an NCB’s decisions are 
incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB as far as ESCB-related 
tasks are concerned.39 
Prohibition on censoring decisions on legal grounds 
A right for bodies other than independent courts to censor, on legal grounds, decisions 
relating to the performance of ESCB-related tasks is incompatible with the Treaty and 
the Statute of the ESCB, since the performance of these tasks may not be reassessed 
at the political level. A right of an NCB Governor to suspend the implementation of a 
decision adopted by the ESCB or by an NCB decision-making body on legal grounds 
and subsequently to submit it to a political body for a final decision would be equivalent 
to seeking instructions from third parties. 
Prohibition on participation in decision-making bodies of an NCB with a right to 
vote 
Participation by representatives of third parties in an NCB’s decision-making body with 
a right to vote on matters concerning the performance by the NCB of ESCB-related 
tasks is incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, even if such vote is 
not decisive.40 Such participation even without the right to vote is incompatible with 
the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, if such participation interferes with the 
performance of ESCB-related tasks by that decision-making bodies or endangers 
compliance with the ESCB’s confidentiality regime.41 
Prohibition on ex ante consultation relating to an NCB’s decision 
An express statutory obligation for an NCB to consult third parties ex ante relating to 
an NCB’s decision provides third parties with a formal mechanism to influence the final 
decision and is therefore incompatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. 
However, dialogue between an NCB and third parties, even when based on statutory 
obligations to provide information and exchange views, is compatible with central bank 
independence provided that: 
• this does not result in interference with the independence of the members of the
NCB’s decision-making bodies;

40 Regarding voting in general, the secret character of voting may contribute to safeguarding the 
independence of an NCB’s decision-making bodies. However, the possibility of open voting is not 
excluded by the principle of institutional independence, see paragraph 2.3 of Opinion CON/2022/10.

• the special status of Governors in their capacity as members of the ECB’s
decision-making bodies is fully respected; and
• confidentiality requirements resulting from the Statute of the ESCB are
observed.42
Discharge provided for the duties of members of the NCB’s decision-making 
bodies 
Statutory provisions regarding the discharge provided by third parties (e.g. 
governments) regarding the duties of members of the NCB’s decision-making bodies 
(e.g. in relation to accounts) should contain adequate safeguards, so that such a 
power does not impinge on the capacity of the individual NCB member independently 
to adopt decisions in respect of ESCB-related tasks (or implement decisions adopted 
at ESCB level). Inclusion of an express provision to this effect in NCB statutes is 
recommended. 
Personal independence 
Article 130 of the Treaty and Articles 7 and 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB further 
safeguard central bank independence in relation to Governors and members of NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies. Governors are members of the General Council of the ECB 
and become members of the Governing Council upon adoption of the euro by their 
Member States. Governors cannot be regarded as representatives of a Member State 
when they perform their duties as members of the Governing Council or the General 
Council of the ECB.43 Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that NCB 
statutes must, in particular, provide for a minimum term of office of five years for 
Governors. It also protects against Governors being arbitrarily relieved from their 
office by providing that they may only be relieved from office if they no longer fulfil the 
conditions required for performing their duties or if they have been found guilty of 
serious misconduct. In such cases, Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB provides for 
the possibility of recourse to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has the 
power to annul the national decision taken to relieve a Governor from office.44 The 
suspension of a Governor may effectively amount to relieving a Governor from office 
for the purposes of Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB.45 NCB statutes must 
comply with this provision as set out below. 
Article 130 of the Treaty prohibits national governments and any bodies from 
influencing the members of NCBs’ decision-making bodies in the performance of their 
tasks. In particular, Member States may not seek to influence the members of the

NCB’s decision-making bodies by amending national legislation affecting their 
remuneration, which, as a matter of principle, should apply only for future 
appointments.46 However, the independence requirements laid down in Article 130 of 
the Treaty are not breached by changes in the remuneration of the members of NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies which are based on objective criteria, for example, by 
benchmarking salaries with the aim of ensuring proportionality between the different 
hierarchical positions at an NCB.47 
Minimum term of office for Governors 
In accordance with Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, NCB statutes must provide 
for a minimum term of office of five years for a Governor. This does not preclude 
longer terms of office, while an indefinite term of office does not require adaptation of 
the statutes provided the grounds for the relieving a Governor from office are in line 
with those of Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. Shorter periods cannot be 
justified even if only applied during a transitional period.48 National legislation which 
provides for a compulsory retirement age should ensure that the retirement age does 
not interrupt the minimum term of office provided by Article 14.2 of the Statute of the 
ESCB, which prevails over any compulsory retirement age, if applicable to a 
Governor.49 When NCB statutes are amended, the amending law should safeguard 
the security of tenure of the Governor and of other members of decision-making 
bodies who are involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks.50 
Grounds for relieving Governors from office 
NCB statutes must ensure that Governors may not be dismissed for reasons other 
than those mentioned in Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. The purpose of the 
requirement under that Article is to prevent the authorities involved in the appointment 
of Governors, particularly the relevant government or parliament, from arbitrarily 
dismissing a Governor. NCB statutes should delete any incompatibility with the 
grounds for relieving from office laid down in Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB or 
omit any mention of grounds for relieving from office (since Article 14.2 is directly 
applicable).51 Once elected or appointed, Governors may not be relieved from office 
under conditions other than those mentioned in Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB 
even if they have not yet taken up their duties. As the conditions under which a 
Governor may be relieved from office are autonomous concepts of Union law, their

application and interpretation do not depend on national contexts.52 Ultimately, it is for 
the Court of Justice of the European Union, in accordance with the powers conferred 
on it by Article 14.2, second subparagraph, of the Statute of the ESCB, to interpret 
these concepts.53 
Security of tenure and grounds for relieving from office of members of NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies, other than Governors, who are involved in the 
performance of ESCB-related tasks 
Applying the same rules for the security of tenure and grounds for relieving of 
Governors from office to other members of the decision-making bodies of NCBs 
involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks will also safeguard the personal 
independence of those persons.54 Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute 
of the ESCB refer to “members of the decision-making bodies” of NCBs, rather than to 
Governors specifically. This applies in particular where a Governor is “first among 
equals” with colleagues with equivalent voting rights or where such other members are 
involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks. 
Right of judicial review 
Governors as well as other members of the NCBs’ decision-making bodies must have 
the right to submit any decision to relieve them from their office to an independent 
court of law, in order to limit the potential for political discretion in evaluating the 
grounds for such a decision. 
Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB stipulates that Governors who have been 
dismissed from office may refer such a decision to the Court of Justice of the 
European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union has the power to annul 
the national measure of dismissal if it is found to be contrary to Union law. 
On the basis of Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
national legislation should provide for a right of review by the national courts of a 
decision to dismiss members of NCBs’ decision-making bodies (other than 
Governors) involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks.55 This right can either 
be a matter of general law or can it take the form of a specific provision. Even though 
this right may be available under the general law, for reasons of legal certainty it could 
be advisable to provide specifically for such a right of review.

Safeguards against conflicts of interest 
Personal independence also entails ensuring that no conflict of interest arises 
between the duties of members of NCB decision-making bodies involved in the 
performance of ESCB-related tasks in relation to their respective NCBs (and of 
Governors also in relation to the ECB) and any other functions which such members of 
decision-making bodies may have and which may jeopardise their personal 
independence.56 As a matter of principle, membership of a decision-making body 
involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks is incompatible with the exercise of 
other functions that might create a conflict of interest. In particular, members of such 
decision-making bodies may not hold an office or have an interest that may influence 
their activities, whether through office in the executive or legislative branches of the 
state or in regional or local administrations, or through involvement in a business 
organisation. Particular care should be taken to prevent potential conflicts of interest 
on the part of non-executive members of decision-making bodies. 
Financial independence 
The overall independence of an NCB would be jeopardised if it could not 
autonomously avail itself of sufficient financial resources to fulfil its mandate, i.e. to 
perform the ESCB-related tasks required of it under the Treaty and the Statute of the 
ESCB.57 
Member States may not put their NCBs in a position where they have insufficient 
financial resources and inadequate net equity58 to carry out their ESCB or 
Eurosystem-related tasks, as applicable. This would be the case if, for example, an 
NCB was precluded from building up adequate financial resources in the form of 
reserves or buffers to offset losses, particularly those resulting from monetary policy 
operations, and the Member State concerned did not ensure in advance that the NCB 
had the necessary funds to bear the financial burden resulting from exercising a 
function outside the scope of the ESCB (such as the funds necessary to be able to pay 
the compensation resulting from the liability regime for that function), while retaining its 
ability to carry out its ESCB tasks effectively and independently.59 It should be noted 
that Articles 28.1 and 30.4 of the Statute of the ESCB provide for the possibility of the 
ECB making further calls on the NCBs to contribute to the ECB’s capital and to make 
further transfers of foreign reserves.60 Moreover, Article 33.2 of the Statute of the 
ESCB provides61 that, in the event of a loss incurred by the ECB which cannot be fully 
56  In this regard, Member States are free to set the conditions required for the appointment of the members 
of the decision-making bodies of their NCBs, provided that they do not conflict with the features of central 
bank independence flowing from the Treaties. See Opinions CON/2018/23, CON/2020/19 and

offset against the general reserve fund, the ECB’s Governing Council may decide to 
offset the remaining loss against the monetary income of the relevant financial year in 
proportion to and up to the amounts allocated to the NCBs. The principle of financial 
independence means that compliance with these provisions requires an NCB to be 
able to perform its functions unimpaired. 
For all the reasons mentioned above, financial independence also implies that an NCB 
should always be sufficiently capitalised. In particular, any situation should be avoided 
whereby for a prolonged period of time an NCB’s net equity is below the level of its 
statutory capital or is even negative, including where losses beyond the level of capital 
and the reserves are carried over.62 Any such situation may negatively impact on the 
NCB’s ability to perform its ESCB-related tasks. Moreover, such a situation may affect 
the credibility of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy. Therefore, the event of an NCB’s 
net equity becoming less than its statutory capital or even negative would require that 
the respective Member State provides the NCB with an appropriate amount of capital 
at least up to the level of the statutory capital within a reasonable period of time so as 
to comply with the principle of financial independence. As concerns the ECB, the 
relevance of this issue has already been recognised by the Council by adopting 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1009/2000.63 It enabled the Governing Council of the 
ECB to decide on an actual increase of the ECB’s capital to sustain the adequacy of 
the capital base to support the operations of the ECB;64 NCBs should be financially 
able to respond to such ECB decision. 
The concept of financial independence should be assessed from the perspective of 
whether any third party is able to exercise either direct or indirect influence not only 
over an NCB’s ESCB-related tasks but also over its ability to fulfil its mandate 
financially in terms of appropriate financial resources. The aspects of financial 
independence set out below are particularly relevant in this respect.65 These are the 
features of financial independence where NCBs are most vulnerable to outside 
influence. 
Determination of budget 
If a third party has the power to determine or influence an NCB’s budget, this is 
incompatible with financial independence unless the law provides a safeguard clause 
so that such a power is without prejudice to the financial means necessary for carrying 
out the NCB’s ESCB-related tasks.66

The accounting rules 
The accounts should be drawn up either in accordance with general accounting rules 
or in accordance with rules specified by an NCB’s decision-making bodies. If, instead, 
such rules are specified by third parties, the rules must at least take into account what 
has been proposed by the NCB’s decision-making bodies. 
The annual accounts should be adopted by the NCB’s decision-making bodies, 
assisted by independent accountants, and may be subject to ex post approval by third 
parties (e.g. the government or parliament). The NCB’s decision-making bodies 
should be able to decide on the calculation of the profits independently and 
professionally. 
Where an NCB’s operations are subject to the control of a state audit office or similar 
body charged with controlling the use of public finances, the scope of the control 
should be clearly defined by the legal framework,67 should be without prejudice to the 
activities of the NCB’s independent external auditors68 and further, in line with the 
principle of institutional independence, it should comply with the prohibition on giving 
instructions to an NCB and its decision-making bodies and should not interfere with 
the NCB’s ESCB-related tasks.69 The state audit should be done on a non-political, 
independent and purely professional basis.70 
Distribution of profits, NCBs’ capital and financial provisions 
With regard to profit allocation, an NCB’s statutes may prescribe how its profits are to 
be allocated. In the absence of such provisions, decisions on the allocation of profits 
should be taken by the NCB’s decision-making bodies on professional grounds, and 
should not be subject to the discretion of third parties unless there is an express 
safeguard clause stating that this is without prejudice to the financial means necessary 
for carrying out the NCB’s ESCB-related tasks.71 
Profits may be distributed to the State budget only after any accumulated losses from 
previous years have been covered and financial provisions deemed necessary to 
safeguard the real value of the NCB’s capital and assets have been created.72 
Temporary or ad hoc legislative measures amounting to instructions to the NCBs in 
relation to the distribution of their profits are not permissible.73 Similarly, a tax on an

NCB’s unrealised capital gains would also impair the principle of financial 
independence.74 
A Member State may not impose reductions of capital on an NCB without the ex ante 
agreement of the NCB’s decision-making bodies, which must aim to ensure that it 
retains sufficient financial means to fulfil its mandate under Article 127(2) of the Treaty 
and the Statute of the ESCB as a member of the ESCB. For the same reason, any 
amendment to the profit distribution rules of an NCB should only be initiated and 
decided in close cooperation with the NCB, which is best placed to assess its required 
level of reserve capital.75 As regards financial provisions or buffers, NCBs must be 
free to independently create financial provisions to safeguard the real value of their 
capital and assets. Member States may also not hamper NCBs from building up their 
reserve capital to a level which is necessary for a member of the ESCB to fulfil its 
tasks.76 
Financial liability for supervisory authorities 
Most Member States place their financial supervisory authorities within their NCB. 
This is unproblematic if such authorities are subject to the NCB’s independent 
decision-making. However, if the law provides for separate decision-making by such 
supervisory authorities, it is important to ensure that decisions adopted by them do not 
endanger the finances of the NCB as a whole. In such cases, national legislation 
should enable the NCB to have ultimate control over any decision by the supervisory 
authorities that could affect an NCB’s independence, in particular its financial 
independence.77 
Autonomy in staff matters 
Member States may not impair an NCB’s ability to employ and retain the qualified staff 
necessary for the NCB to perform independently the tasks conferred on it by the 
Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.78 Also, an NCB may not be put into a position 
where it has limited control or no control over its staff, or where the government of a 
Member State can influence its policy on staff matters.79 Any amendment to the 
legislative provisions on the remuneration for members of an NCB’s decision-making 
bodies and its employees should be decided in close and effective cooperation with 
the NCB,80 taking due account of its views, to ensure the ongoing ability of the NCB to

independently carry out its tasks.81 Autonomy in staff matters extends to issues 
relating to staff pensions. Further, amendments that lead to reductions in the 
remuneration for an NCB’s staff should not interfere with that NCB’s powers to 
administer its own financial resources, including the funds resulting from any reduction 
in salaries that it pays.82 
Ownership and property rights 
Rights of third parties to intervene or to issue instructions to an NCB in relation to the 
property held by an NCB are incompatible with the principle of financial independence. 
2.2.4 Confidentiality 
The obligation of professional secrecy for ECB and NCB staff as well as for the 
members of the ECB and NCB governing bodies under Article 37 of the Statute of the 
ESCB may give rise to similar provisions in NCBs’ statutes or in the Member States’ 
legislation. The primacy of Union law and rules adopted thereunder also means that 
national laws on access by third parties to documents should comply with relevant 
Union law provisions, including Article 37 of the Statute of the ESCB, and may not lead 
to infringements of the ESCB’s confidentiality regime.83 The access of a state audit 
office or similar body to an NCB’s confidential information and documents must be 
limited to what is necessary for the performance of the statutory tasks of the body that 
receives the information and must be without prejudice to the ESCB’s independence 
and the ESCB’s confidentiality regime to which the members of NCBs’ 
decision-making bodies and staff are subject.84 NCBs should ensure that such bodies 
protect the confidentiality of information and documents disclosed at a level 
corresponding to that applied by the NCBs. 
2.2.5 Prohibition on monetary financing and privileged access 
On the monetary financing prohibition and the prohibition on privileged access, the 
national legislation of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004, 2007 or 2013 had 
to be adapted to comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of 
the ESCB and be in force on 1 May 2004, 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2013 
respectively. Sweden had to bring the necessary adaptations into force by 1 January

Prohibition on monetary financing 
Article 123(1) of the Treaty prohibits overdraft facilities or any other type of credit 
facility with the ECB or with the NCBs in favour of EU institutions, bodies, offices or 
agencies, central governments, regional, local, or other public authorities, other 
bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States. 
It also prohibits the purchase directly from these public sector entities by the ECB or 
NCBs of debt instruments. The Treaty contains one exemption from this monetary 
financing prohibition: it does not apply to publicly owned credit institutions which, in the 
context of the supply of reserves by central banks, must be given the same treatment 
as private credit institutions (Article 123(2) of the Treaty). The precise scope of 
application of the monetary financing prohibition is further clarified by Council 
Regulation (EC) No 3603/93,85 according to which the prohibition includes any 
financing of the public sector’s obligations vis-à-vis third parties. 
The monetary financing prohibition aims to encourage the Member States to follow a 
sound budgetary policy not allowing monetary financing of public deficits (or privileged 
access by public authorities to the financial markets) to lead to excessively high levels 
of debt or excessive Member State deficits.86 Therefore the prohibition must be 
interpreted extensively in order to ensure its strict application, subject only to the 
limited exemptions contained in Article 123(2) of the Treaty and Regulation (EC) No 
3603/93. Thus, even if Article 123(1) of the Treaty refers specifically to “credit 
facilities”, i.e. with the obligation to repay the funds, the prohibition applies a fortiori to 
other forms of funding, i.e. without the obligation to repay. 
The ECB’s general stance on the compatibility of national legislation with the 
prohibition has primarily been developed within the framework of consultations of the 
ECB by Member States on draft national legislation under Articles 127(4) and 282(5) 
of the Treaty.87 
National legislation relating to the scope of application of the monetary 
financing prohibition 
National legislation may not narrow the scope of application of the monetary financing 
prohibition or extend the exemptions available under EU law. For example, national 
legislation providing for the financing by the NCB of a Member State’s financial 
commitments to international financial institutions or to third countries is, in principle, 
incompatible with the monetary financing prohibition. As an exemption, Regulation 
(EC) No 3603/93 allows for the financing by the NCBs of obligations falling upon the 
85  Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93 of 13 December 1993 specifying definitions for the application of the 
prohibitions referred to in Articles 104 and 104b (1) of the Treaty (OJ L 332, 31.12.1993, p. 1). Articles 
104 and 104b(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community are now Articles 123 and 125(1) of 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 
86  Peter Gauweiler and Others, C-62/14, ECLI:EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 100. Article 123 of the Treaty 
also serves the objective of maintaining price stability and reinforces central bank independence.

public sector vis-à-vis the IMF provided that it results in foreign claims which have all 
the characteristics of reserve assets.88 The relevant characteristics that determine the 
reserve asset quality of the claims concern their availability on demand to meet 
balance of payments financing needs and other related purposes, which implies that 
the credit quality and liquidity of the claims must be ensured.89 
National legislation conferring tasks upon NCBs 
National legislation assigning tasks to NCBs may not lead to any financing of the 
public sector’s obligations vis-à vis third parties. In accordance with Article 14.4 of the 
Statute of the ESCB, NCBs may perform functions other than those specified in the 
Statute of the ESCB unless the Governing Council finds that these functions interfere 
with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB. Where a Member State assigns such a 
function to its NCB, that NCB is responsible and liable for the performance of that 
function. Nevertheless, when defining the responsibility and liability of an NCB in 
relation to that function, Member States are required to comply with their obligations 
deriving from Union law and, in particular, Article 123(1) of the Treaty.90 
Article 1(1), point (b), of Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/93 defines the term “other 
type of credit facility” for the purposes of Article 123 of the Treaty as, inter alia, any 
financing of the public sector’s obligations vis-à-vis third parties. Accordingly, the NCB 
concerned must not assume obligations vis-a-vis third parties that could potentially be 
incumbent on the public sector. Consequently, the NCB concerned must not finance 
pre-existing obligations vis-à-vis third parties that are incumbent on other public 
authorities or bodies and the effective financing of the obligations vis-à-vis third parties 
by the NCB concerned must not result directly from the measures adopted or the 
policy choices made by other public authorities or bodies.91 
Advanced distribution of central bank profits 
National legislation may not require the distribution of central bank profits which have 
not been fully realised, accounted for and audited. To comply with the monetary 
financing prohibition, the amount distributed to the State budget pursuant to the 
applicable profit distribution rules cannot be paid, even partially, from the NCB’s 
reserve capital. Therefore, profit distribution rules should leave unaffected the NCB’s 
reserve capital. Moreover, when NCB assets are transferred to the State, they must be

remunerated at market value and the transfer should take place at the same time as 
the remuneration.92 
Similarly, intervention in the performance of other Eurosystem tasks, such as the 
management of foreign reserves, by introducing taxation of theoretical and unrealised 
capital gains is not permitted since this would result in a form of central bank credit to 
the public sector through the advanced distribution of future and uncertain profits.93 
Assumption of public sector liabilities 
National legislation which requires an NCB to take over the liabilities of a previously 
independent public body, as a result of a national reorganisation of certain tasks and 
duties (for example, in the context of a transfer to the NCB of certain supervisory tasks 
previously carried out by the state or independent public authorities or bodies), without 
fully insulating the NCB from all financial obligations resulting from the prior activities 
of such a body, would be incompatible with the monetary financing prohibition.94 
National legislation holding an NCB liable on account of the exercise of a task 
assigned to it under national law would entail the assumption of a pre-existing 
obligation vis-à-vis third parties and be incompatible with the monetary financing 
prohibition if the third parties who have suffered harm were not compensated as a 
result of the NCB’s actions, i.e. the infringement by the NCB of the rules imposed on it 
in that context.95 In addition, in case of tasks that require implementation of highly 
complex and urgent measures, such as those relating to the reorganisation or 
resolution of banks or central counterparties, national legislation holding an NCB liable 
on account of the exercise of such tasks would amount to the effective financing of the 
obligations vis-à-vis third parties if the NCB’s liability was not limited to infringements 
of a serious nature of the rules imposed on it in that context.96 
The Court of Justice has not yet elaborated on what the limitations to infringements of 
a serious nature of the rules imposed on an NCB exactly consist of. In view of the 
different traditions for the liability of NCBs in the Member States’ national legal orders, 
such limitations may take different forms provided that they exclude the effective 
financing of the obligations of the public sector vis-à-vis third parties. This is the case if 
national law addresses the condition of fault and limits the liability of the NCB 
concerned to gross negligence in view of the urgency and complexity of the case at 
hand.97 The effective financing of the obligations of the public sector vis-à-vis third 
parties is also excluded if national law addresses the condition of unlawful conduct 
instead of fault and limits judicial review or relevant measures by granting a large

margin of discretion to the NCB concerned in view of the urgency and complexity of 
the case at hand.98 
Financial support for credit and/or financial institutions 
National legislation which provides for financing by an NCB, even if granted 
independently and at their full discretion, of insolvent credit and/or other financial 
institutions would be incompatible with the monetary financing prohibition. 
The same would apply to the Eurosystem financing of a credit institution which has 
been recapitalised to restore its solvency by way of a direct placement of state-issued 
debt instruments where no alternative market-based funding sources exist 
(hereinafter “recapitalisation bonds”), and where such bonds are to be used as 
collateral. In such case of a state recapitalisation of a credit institution by way of direct 
placement of recapitalisation bonds, the subsequent use of the recapitalisation bonds 
as collateral in central bank liquidity operations raises monetary financing concerns.99 
Emergency liquidity assistance, granted by an NCB independently and at its full 
discretion to a solvent credit institution on the basis of collateral security in the form of 
a State guarantee, has to meet the following criteria: (a) it must be ensured that the 
credit provided by the NCB is as short term as possible; (b) there must be systemic 
stability aspects at stake; (c) there must be no doubts as to the legal validity and 
enforceability of the State guarantee under applicable national law; and (iv) there must 
be no doubts as to the economic adequacy of the State guarantee, which should cover 
both principal and interest on the loans.100 
Financial support for resolution funds or financial arrangements and deposit 
insurance or investor compensation schemes 
The financing by an NCB of a resolution fund or a deposit guarantee fund that qualifies 
as a “body governed by public law” within the meaning of Article 123(1) of the Treaty is 
not compatible with the monetary financing prohibition. A body is “governed by public 
law” if it has all of the following characteristics: (a) it is established for the specific 
purpose of meeting needs in the general interest, not having an industrial or 
commercial character; (b) it has legal personality; and (c) it is closely dependent on the 
public sector entities referred to in Article 123(1) of the Treaty. A close dependence on 
those public sector entities is presumed when a body is financed, for the most part, by 
them; or is subject to management supervision by them; or has an administrative, 
managerial or supervisory board, more than half of whose members are appointed by 
them.101

Even if the financing is not provided to a “body governed by public law”, the financing 
of any resolution fund or financial arrangement is not in line with the monetary 
financing prohibition.102 Where an NCB acts as resolution authority, it should not, 
under any circumstances, assume or finance any obligation of either a bridge 
institution or an asset management vehicle.103 To this end, national legislation should 
clarify that the NCB will not assume or finance any of these entities’ obligations.104 
The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive105 and the Investor Compensation 
Schemes Directive106 provide that the costs of financing deposit guarantee schemes 
and investor compensation schemes must be borne, respectively, by credit institutions 
and investment firms themselves. With the exception of financing a “body governed by 
public law”, national legislation which provides for the financing by an NCB of a 
national deposit insurance scheme for credit institutions or a national investor 
compensation scheme for investment firms would be compatible with the monetary 
financing prohibition only if it were short term, addressed urgent situations, systemic 
stability aspects were at stake, and decisions were at the NCB’s discretion.107 In 
particular, central bank support for deposit guarantee schemes should not amount to a 
systematic pre-funding operation.108 
Fiscal agency function 
Article 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB establishes that the “ECB and the national 
central banks may act as fiscal agents” for “Union institutions, bodies, offices or 
agencies, central governments, regional local or other public authorities, other bodies 
governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States”. The purpose of 
Article 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB is, following transfer of the monetary policy 
competence to the Eurosystem, to clarify that NCBs may continue to provide the fiscal 
agent service traditionally provided to governments and other public entities without 
infringing the monetary financing prohibition. In addition, Regulation (EC) No 3603/93 
establishes a number of explicit and narrowly drafted exemptions from the monetary 
financing prohibition relating to the fiscal agency function, as follows: (a) intra-day 
credits to the public sector are permitted provided that they remain limited to the day 
and that no extension is possible;109 (b) crediting the public sector’s account with 
cheques issued by third parties before the drawee bank has been debited is permitted 
if a fixed period of time corresponding to the normal period for the collection of 
cheques by the NCB concerned has elapsed since receipt of the cheque, provided

that any float which may arise is exceptional, is of a small amount and averages out in 
the short term;110 and (c) the holding of coins issued by and credited to the public 
sector is permitted where the amount of such assets remains at less than 10 % of 
coins in circulation.111 
National legislation on the fiscal agency function should be compatible with EU law in 
general, and with the monetary financing prohibition in particular.112 Taking into 
account the express recognition in Article 21.2 of the Statute of the ESCB of the 
provision of fiscal agency services, which is a legitimate function traditionally 
performed by NCBs, the provision by central banks of fiscal agency services complies 
with the monetary financing prohibition, provided that such services remain within the 
field of the fiscal agency function and do not constitute central bank financing of public 
sector obligations vis-à-vis third parties or central bank crediting of the public sector 
outside the narrowly defined exceptions specified in Regulation (EC) No 3603/93.113 
National legislation that enables an NCB to hold government deposits and to service 
government accounts does not raise concerns about compliance with the monetary 
financing prohibition as long as such provisions do not enable the extension of credit, 
including overnight overdrafts. However, there would be a concern about compliance 
with the monetary financing prohibition if, for example, national legislation were to 
enable the remuneration of deposits or current account balances above, rather than at 
or below, market rates. Remuneration that is above market rates constitutes a de facto 
credit, contrary to the objective of the prohibition on monetary financing, and might 
therefore undermine that objective. It is essential for any remuneration of an account 
to reflect market parameters and it is particularly important to correlate the 
remuneration rate of the deposits with their maturity.114 Moreover, the provision 
without remuneration by an NCB of fiscal agent services does not raise monetary 
financing concerns, provided they are core fiscal agent services.115 
Prohibition on privileged access 
Article 124 of the Treaty provides that “[a]ny measure, not based on prudential 
considerations, establishing privileged access by Union institutions, bodies, offices or 
agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies 
governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States to financial 
institutions, shall be prohibited”. As with the monetary financing prohibition, the 
prohibition of privileged access aims to encourage the Member States to follow a 
sound budgetary policy, not allowing (monetary financing of public deficits or)

privileged access by public authorities to the financial markets to lead to excessively 
high levels of debt or excessive Member State deficits.116 
Under Article 1(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3604/93,117 privileged access is 
understood as any law, regulation or other binding legal instrument adopted in the 
exercise of public authority which: (a) obliges financial institutions to acquire or to hold 
liabilities of EU institutions or bodies, central governments, regional, local or other 
public authorities, other bodies governed by public law or public undertakings of 
Member States, or (b) confers tax advantages that only benefit financial institutions or 
financial advantages that do not comply with the principles of a market economy, in 
order to encourage those institutions to acquire or hold such liabilities. 
As public authorities, NCBs may not take measures granting privileged access to 
financial institutions by the public sector if such measures are not based on prudential 
considerations. Furthermore, the rules on the mobilisation or pledging of debt 
instruments enacted by the NCBs must not be used as a means of circumventing the 
prohibition on privileged access.118 Member States’ legislation in this area may not 
establish such privileged access. 
Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 3604/93 defines “prudential considerations” as those 
which underlie national laws, regulations or administrative actions based on, or 
consistent with, EU law and designed to promote the soundness of financial 
institutions so as to strengthen the stability of the financial system as a whole and the 
protection of the customers of those institutions. Prudential considerations seek to 
ensure that banks remain solvent with regard to their depositors.119 In the area of 
prudential supervision, EU secondary legislation has established a number of 
requirements to ensure the soundness of credit institutions.120 A “credit institution” has 
been defined as an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other 
repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account.121 
Additionally, credit institutions, commonly referred to as “banks”, require an 
authorisation by a competent Member State authority to provide services.122 
Although minimum reserves might be seen as a part of prudential requirements, they 
are part of an NCB’s operational framework and used as a monetary policy tool in

most economies, including in the euro area.123 In this respect, paragraph 2 of Annex I 
to Guideline (EU) 2015/510 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2014/60)124 states 
that the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system primarily pursues the aims of 
stabilising the money market interest rates and creating (or enlarging) a structural 
liquidity shortage.125 The ECB requires credit institutions established in the euro area 
to hold the required minimum reserves (in the form of deposits) on account with their 
NCB.126 
This report focuses on the compatibility both of national legislation or rules adopted by 
NCBs and of the NCBs’ statutes with the Treaty prohibition on privileged access. 
However, this report is without prejudice to an assessment of whether laws, 
regulations, rules or administrative acts in Member States are used under the cover of 
prudential considerations as a means of circumventing the prohibition on privileged 
access. Such an assessment is beyond the scope of this report. 
2.2.6 Single spelling of the euro 
Article 3(4) of the Treaty on European Union lays down that the “Union shall establish 
an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro”. In the texts of the 
Treaties in all the authentic languages written using the Roman alphabet, the euro is 
consistently identified in the nominative singular case as “euro”. In the Greek alphabet 
text, the euro is spelled “ευρώ” and in the Cyrillic alphabet text the euro is spelled 
“евро”.127 Consistent with this, Regulation (EC) No 974/98 makes it clear that the 
name of the single currency must be the same in all the official languages of the EU, 
taking into account the existence of different alphabets. The Treaties thus require a 
single spelling of the word “euro” in the nominative singular case in all EU and national 
legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets. 
In view of the exclusive competence of the EU to determine the name of the single 
currency, any deviations from this rule are incompatible with the Treaties and should

125  The higher the reserve requirement is set, the fewer funds banks will have to loan out, leading to lower 
money creation.

127  The “Declaration by the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Malta on the 
spelling of the name of the single currency in the Treaties”, annexed to the Treaties, states that; “Without 
prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in 
the Treaties as displayed on banknotes and on coins, Latvia, Hungary and Malta declare that the spelling 
of the name of the single currency, including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian, Hungarian 
and Maltese text of the Treaties, has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian, Hungarian or Maltese 
languages”.

be eliminated.128 While this principle applies to all national legislation, the assessment 
in the country chapters focuses on the NCBs’ statutes and the euro changeover laws. 
2.2.7 Legal integration of NCBs into the Eurosystem 
Provisions in national legislation (in particular an NCB’s statutes, but also other 
legislation) which would prevent the performance of Eurosystem-related tasks or 
compliance with the ECB’s decisions are incompatible with the effective operation of 
the Eurosystem once the Member State concerned has adopted the euro. National 
legislation therefore has to be adapted to ensure compatibility with the Treaty and the 
Statute of the ESCB in respect of Eurosystem-related tasks. To comply with Article 
131 of the Treaty, national legislation had to be adjusted to ensure its compatibility by 
the date of establishment of the ESCB (as regards Sweden) and by 1 May 2004, 1 
January 2007 and 1 July 2013 (as regards the Member States that joined the EU on 
these dates). Nevertheless, statutory requirements relating to the full legal integration 
of an NCB into the Eurosystem need only enter into force at the moment that full 
integration becomes effective, i.e. the date on which the Member State with a 
derogation adopts the euro. 
The main areas examined in this report are those in which statutory provisions may 
hinder NCBs’ compliance with the Eurosystem’s requirements. These include 
provisions (a) that could prevent NCBs from taking part in implementing the single 
monetary policy, as defined by the ECB’s decision-making bodies, or (b) that could 
hinder a Governor from fulfilling their duties as a member of the ECB’s Governing 
Council, or (c) that do not respect the ECB’s prerogatives, or (d) that do not recognise 
that the exclusive competence for ESCB-related tasks in Member States whose 
currency is the euro is irrevocably conferred on the Union,129 or (e) pursuant to which 
NCBs in the performance of their ESCB-related tasks are bound by decisions of 
national authorities that conflict with legal acts of the ECB. Distinctions are made 
between economic policy objectives, tasks, financial provisions, exchange rate policy 
and international cooperation. Finally, other areas where NCBs’ statutes may need to 
be adapted are mentioned. 
Economic policy objectives 
The full integration of an NCB into the Eurosystem requires its statutory objectives to 
be compatible with the ESCB’s objectives, as laid down in Article 2 of the Statute of the 
ESCB. Among other things, this means that statutory objectives with a “national 
flavour” – for example, where statutory provisions refer to an obligation to conduct 
monetary policy within the framework of the general economic policy of the Member 
State concerned – need to be adapted. Furthermore, an NCB’s secondary objectives 
must be consistent and not interfere with its obligation to support the general

economic policies in the EU with a view to contributing to the achievement of the 
objectives of the EU as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, which 
is itself an objective expressed to be without prejudice to maintaining price stability.130 
Tasks 
The tasks of an NCB of a Member State whose currency is the euro are predominantly 
determined by the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, given that NCB’s status as an 
integral part of the Eurosystem. In order to comply with Article 131 of the Treaty, 
provisions on tasks in an NCB’s statutes therefore need to be compared with the 
relevant provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, and any incompatibility 
must be removed.131 This applies to any provision that, after adoption of the euro and 
integration into the Eurosystem, constitutes an impediment to carrying out 
ESCB-related tasks and in particular to provisions which do not respect the ESCB’s 
powers under Chapter IV of the Statute of the ESCB. 
Any national legislative provisions relating to monetary policy must recognise that the 
EU’s monetary policy is to be carried out through the Eurosystem.132 An NCB’s 
statutes may contain provisions on monetary policy instruments. Such provisions 
should be comparable to those in the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, and any 
incompatibility must be removed in order to comply with Article 131 of the Treaty. 
Monitoring fiscal developments is a task that an NCB carries out on a regular basis to 
assess properly the stance to be taken in monetary policy. NCBs may also present 
their views on relevant fiscal developments on the basis of their monitoring activity and 
the independence of their advice, with a view to contributing to the proper functioning 
of the European Monetary Union. The monitoring of fiscal developments by an NCB 
for monetary policy purposes should be based on the full access to all relevant public 
finance data. Accordingly, the NCBs should be granted unconditional, timely and 
automatic access to all relevant public finance statistics. However, an NCB’s role 
should not go beyond monitoring activities that result from or are linked – directly or 
indirectly – to the discharge of their monetary policy mandate.133 A formal mandate for 
an NCB to assess forecasts and fiscal developments implies a function for the NCB in 
(and a corresponding responsibility for) fiscal policymaking which may risk 
undermining the discharge of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy mandate and the 
NCB’s independence.134

euro area money market should be avoided, as this may impair the implementation of 
the single monetary policy. In particular, this applies to the extension of State 
guarantees to cover interbank deposits.135 
Member States must ensure that national legislative measures addressing liquidity 
problems of businesses or professionals, for example their debts to financial 
institutions, do not have a negative impact on market liquidity. In particular, such 
measures may not be inconsistent with the principle of an open market economy, as 
reflected in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, as this could hinder the flow of 
credit, materially influence the stability of financial institutions and markets and 
therefore affect the performance of Eurosystem tasks.136 
National legislative provisions assigning the exclusive right to issue banknotes to the 
NCB must recognise that, once the euro is adopted, the ECB’s Governing Council has 
the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes, pursuant to Article 128(1) 
of the Treaty and Article 16 of the Statute of the ESCB,137 while the right to issue euro 
banknotes belongs to the ECB and the NCBs. Once the euro is adopted, national 
legislative provisions enabling the government to influence issues such as the 
denominations, production, volume or withdrawal of banknotes must also either be 
repealed or recognition must be given to the ECB’s powers with regard to euro 
banknotes, as set out in the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. 
Irrespective of the division of responsibilities in relation to coins between governments 
and NCBs, the relevant provisions must recognise the ECB’s power to approve the 
volume of issue of euro coins once the euro is adopted. A Member State may not 
consider currency in circulation as its NCB’s debt to the government of that Member 
State, as this would defeat the concept of a single currency and be incompatible with 
the requirements of Eurosystem legal integration.138 
With regard to foreign reserve management,139 any Member State that has adopted 
the euro and which does not transfer its official foreign reserves140 to its NCB is in 
breach of the Treaty. In addition, any right of a third party – for example, the 
government or parliament – to influence an NCB’s decisions with regard to the 
management of the official foreign reserves would be inconsistent with Article 127(2), 
third indent, of the Treaty. Furthermore, NCBs have to provide the ECB with foreign 
reserve assets in proportion to their shares in the ECB’s subscribed capital. This 
means that there must be no legal obstacles to NCBs transferring foreign reserve 
assets to the ECB.

on Member States that have not adopted the euro, Article 5 of the Statute of the 
ESCB, which concerns the collection of statistical information, applies to all Member 
States, regardless of whether they have adopted the euro. Accordingly, Member 
States whose currency is not the euro are under an obligation to design and 
implement, at national level, all measures they consider appropriate to collect the 
statistical information needed to fulfil the ECB’s statistical reporting requirements141 
and to make timely preparations in the field of statistics in order for them to become 
Member States whose currency is the euro.142 National legislation laying down the 
framework for cooperation between the NCBs and national statistical offices should 
guarantee the NCBs’ independence in the performance of their tasks within the 
ESCB’s statistical framework.143 
Financial provisions 
The financial provisions in the Statute of the ESCB comprise rules on financial 
accounts,144 auditing,145 capital subscription,146 the transfer of foreign reserve 
assets147 and the allocation of monetary income.148 NCBs must be able to comply 
with their obligations under these provisions and therefore any incompatible national 
provisions must be repealed.149

3 Country summary for Bulgaria 
In April 2025 the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Bulgaria stood at 
2.7%, i.e. just below the reference value of 2.8% for the criterion on price 
stability. This rate is expected to rise gradually over the coming months, reflecting 
increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, as well as persistent domestic 
price pressures from strong, albeit moderating, wage growth amid tight labour 
markets. The catching-up process is also likely to result in positive inflation 
differentials vis-à-vis the euro area over the longer term, since GDP per capita and 
price levels are still significantly lower in Bulgaria than in the euro area. While 
equilibrium inflation differentials associated with this catching-up process tend not to 
be very large, they may become a concern if they are accompanied by and add to 
potentially unsustainable developments in credit and asset prices. 
Bulgaria is currently not subject to a Council Decision on the existence of an 
excessive deficit. Its general government budget deficit stood at 3.0% of GDP in 
2024, i.e. at the level of the 3% reference value, and its general government gross 
debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 24.1%, i.e. well below the 60% reference value. 
The Bulgarian lev participated in ERM II in the two-year reference period from 
20 May 2023 to 19 May 2025. Over the reference period the lev did not exhibit any 
deviation from the central rate. The agreement on participation in ERM II was based 
on a number of policy commitments by the Bulgarian authorities. While Bulgaria has 
completed almost all of its ERM II post-entry commitments, further progress is needed 
to address the outstanding shortcomings in the area of anti-money laundering and 
countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In particular, Bulgaria is encouraged 
to accelerate its efforts to fulfil the elements of the action plan that was adopted by the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) after Bulgaria was placed on the FATF’s “grey list” 
of jurisdictions under increased monitoring in October 2023. 
Over the reference period from May 2024 to April 2025, long-term interest rates 
in Bulgaria stood at 3.9% on average and were thus below the 5.1% reference 
value for the interest rate convergence criterion. The differential between 
long-term interest rates in Bulgaria and the euro area (GDP-weighted) interest rate did 
not change and stood at 0.9 percentage points at the end of the reference period. 
Capital markets in Bulgaria remain smaller and much less developed than those in the 
euro area. 
Bulgarian law is compatible with the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB as 
required under Article 131 of the Treaty.

4 Examination of economic convergence 
4.1 Price developments 
In April 2025 the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Bulgaria stood at 
2.7%, i.e. just below the reference value of 2.8% for the criterion on price 
stability (Chart 4.5.1). This rate is expected to rise gradually over the coming months, 
reflecting increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, as well as persistent 
domestic price pressures. 
Over the past ten years the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation has 
fluctuated within a very wide range, from -1.4% to 14.1%. After a prolonged period 
in negative territory, inflation turned positive again in 2017. Robust economic growth 
and falling unemployment, together with a longer-term decline in the working age 
population and the process of price and income convergence, as well as 
administrative and policy factors, led to a sharp rise in nominal wages and unit labour 
costs. HICP inflation subsequently fluctuated, mostly ranging between 2% and 3%, 
before dropping to 1.2% in 2020 (Table 4.5.1) owing to the contraction of the Bulgarian 
economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and declines in energy prices. Rising 
global energy and food prices, changes in administered prices and the rebound in 
economic activity and private consumption then pushed up prices in the first half of 
2021. From September that year the rate of inflation accelerated markedly, owing to 
high electricity, fuel and gas prices, and the associated direct and indirect effects. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 exacerbated the increase in global 
commodity prices and supply bottlenecks, leading to a sharp rise in HICP inflation, 
which peaked at 15.6% in September 2022 before starting to decrease. Bulgaria has 
been particularly vulnerable to recent external price fluctuations, owing primarily to 
certain structural features of its economy and its exposure to Russia. By December 
2024 the annual rate of HICP inflation had slowed to 2.1% on account of lower 
commodity prices, easing supply bottlenecks and government measures to mitigate 
the impact of the energy price rises. These were mainly in the form of transfers to 
households and firms, and to a lesser extent changes in indirect taxes. The decline in 
HICP inflation was broad-based across components, with the strongest contribution 
coming from energy and food prices, the same components that fuelled inflation in the 
period 2021-22. 
In April 2025 the annual rate of HICP inflation reached 2.8%. The disinflation trend 
that began at the end of 2022 ceased in January 2025 when the annual rate of HICP 
inflation rose to 3.8%. It then remained around 4% for the next two months, before 
moderating to 2.8% in April (Chart 4.1). The significant rise in HICP inflation in early 
2025 was due to a combination of policy-driven price increases and more broad-based 
price increases across several consumption categories. The policy-driven increases 
resulted from changes in indirect taxes and administered prices, including the end of 
support measures that had been introduced to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. 
Other price increases were concentrated mainly in the services sector, fuelled by 
second-round effects from higher food and energy prices, as well as persistent wage

pressures amid tight labour markets and robust domestic demand supported by strong 
credit and asset price growth. The sharp decline in HICP inflation in April 2025, 
dropping to 2.8% from 4.0% in March, was driven largely by the marked drop in prices 
for hospital services.

(annual percentage changes)

Notes: Solid lines depict annual percentage changes in the monthly HICP. The shaded area shows projections for annual HICP inflation 
from the European Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast. 
The orientation of monetary policy towards price stability has played an 
important role in shaping inflation dynamics in Bulgaria over past decades. On 
1 July 1997 the Bulgarian National Bank introduced a currency board arrangement. 
The Bulgarian lev was initially pegged at par to the Deutsche Mark and since 
1 January 1999 it has been pegged to the euro at a rate of 1.95583 levs per euro. 
Such an arrangement inherently requires fiscal discipline, and over the years 
Bulgaria’s prudent fiscal policy has supported the stability of the currency board, thus 
highlighting the strong interconnection between the two. In 2023, as spillover effects 
from previous monetary policy tightening in the euro area remained limited in Bulgaria, 
the Bulgarian National Bank raised banks’ minimum reserve requirements to withdraw 
some of the excess liquidity from the banking system. 
Inflation is expected to remain elevated in the coming months, driven by strong 
domestic price pressures. According to the European Commission’s Spring 2025 
Economic Forecast, HICP inflation is projected to rise to 3.6% in 2025, before falling to 
1.8% in 2026. Although the pass-through of wages to consumer price inflation has 
been relatively limited so far, domestic price pressures stemming from strong, albeit 
moderating, wage growth are expected to persist over the forecast horizon. At the 
same time, mortgage lending and house price growth remain robust, posing the risk of 
a credit/asset price spiral (see below for more details). This risk is exacerbated by the 
fact that positive inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area might not easily 
self-correct, as higher domestic inflation may lead to more negative real mortgage 
interest rates, which could further fuel housing credit growth and house price

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
appreciation. These forecasts should be viewed in the context of persistent labour 
shortages that are rooted in demographic trends such as low birth rates and rapid 
population ageing. However, they are subject to considerable uncertainty, with risks 
tilted to the upside as inflation in Bulgaria is still relatively more sensitive to external 
price developments than the euro area. Similar to other central and eastern European 
countries, Bulgaria is a small open economy deeply integrated into global supply 
chains, making it particularly vulnerable to international uncertainty and disruptions, 
such as those arising from geopolitical tensions, higher US tariffs and uncertainty 
about trade policies. Since 2022 Bulgaria has effectively eliminated its dependence on 
Russian energy imports through diversification of supply sources. Nevertheless, the 
Bulgarian economy remains exposed to commodity price fluctuations owing to its high 
energy intensity and the significant share of energy and food in the consumption 
basket. 
Looking further ahead, there are other factors that pose risks to the 
sustainability of inflation convergence in Bulgaria over the longer term. This is 
particularly the case because in recent years unit labour costs have risen at a much 
faster pace than in the euro area and other competitor countries (Table 4.1). Given the 
fixed exchange rate with Bulgaria’s main trading partners, this has resulted in a 
notable deterioration in price and cost competitiveness relative to other EU countries 
(Chart 4.2, panel a), particularly in terms of unit labour costs. Over the longer term, the 
catching-up process, while desirable, is likely to result in positive inflation differentials 
vis-à-vis the euro area, since GDP per capita and price levels are still significantly 
lower in Bulgaria than in the euro area (Chart 4.2, panel b). However, existing 
literature suggests that the Balassa-Samuelson effect is not usually very large, 
suggesting that equilibrium inflation differentials may not be a key concern as long as 
they are not accompanied by unsustainable developments in credit and asset prices. 
Nevertheless, the catching-up process needs to be supported by appropriate policies 
in order to avoid unduly jeopardising Bulgaria’s competitiveness and to prevent the 
build-up of unsustainable levels of credit growth and other macroeconomic 
imbalances. In particular, while hourly labour costs in Bulgaria are still the lowest in the 
EU, growth in wages needs to be consistent with that in productivity, among other 
things, in order to safeguard price competitiveness and the country’s attractiveness to 
foreign investors. Moreover, as Bulgaria has been participating in the exchange rate 
mechanism (ERM II) since July 2020 with its existing currency board arrangement in 
place, it is important to contain inflationary pressures with appropriate policies, not 
least to enhance productivity growth by investing in innovation and human capital, 
especially in the non-traded goods sector.

The quality of institutions and governance in Bulgaria present certain 
challenges that could undermine its economic resilience and the sustainability 
of convergence. These challenges may manifest, for example, with respect to the 
business environment, public administration efficiency, tax compliance, corruption, 
social inclusion, transparency, judicial independence and access to online services. A 
less robust institutional framework can limit potential output growth, which could affect 
Bulgaria’s debt servicing capacity and complicate economic adjustments. It may also 
hinder Bulgaria’s ability to implement policy measures. Various institutional indicators 
point to a need for improvement in Bulgaria’s institutional quality and governance, with

limited progress observed in recent decades (Chart 4.3).150 Bulgaria is among the EU

euro area from 2003 onwards; the light blue dots indicate countries that joined the euro area before 2003. 
Achieving an environment that is conducive to sustainable convergence in 
Bulgaria requires stability-oriented economic policies and wide-ranging 
structural reforms. As monetary policy cannot be tailored to country-specific 
circumstances, other policy areas (fiscal, macroprudential) should provide the 
economy with the means to cope with potential country-specific shocks and 
macroeconomic imbalances. This is also reflected in a number of Bulgaria’s ERM II 
150  Measuring institutional quality is challenging and inevitably involves a degree of judgement. On the one 
hand, perception-based indicators can have some merit when compared with other indicators. One 
advantage of perception-based surveys resides in their catch-all nature, whereas more specific 
measures may provide highly distorted information. Also, while the absolute value of perception-based 
indicators may be questionable, they are useful for cross-country comparisons, unless it is clear that 
there is a systematic bias against one or more specific countries. Moreover, indicators that are based 
solely on the content of laws, but not on detailed knowledge of their actual implementation, can be 
misleading. Furthermore, as no institutional model may be presumed to be preferable ex ante, 
perception-based surveys may prevent the emergence of measurement biases when gauging the 
various dimensions of economic governance directly. On the other hand, perception-based surveys also 
produce distortions. For instance, they may be heavily influenced by a recent episode or poorly designed 
questions. Moreover, as regards EU countries, the institutional focus has only gained analytical and 
policy prominence in recent years. There is thus, generally speaking, still ample scope for measurement 
improvements. Finally, cross-country approaches to an issue as complex as institutional quality or good 
governance are necessarily somewhat insufficient and clearly need to be complemented with more 
country-specific and longer-term assessments. At the same time, measurement difficulties should not 
lead to a down-playing of these crucially important determinants of long-term prosperity, social fairness 
and well-being.

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
post-entry commitments, which are discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. In 
addition, structural reforms to enhance the business and institutional environment are 
crucial in order to attract foreign direct investment and boost potential growth. These 
include Bulgaria’s commitment to further reduce corruption, ensure an independent 
and effective judicial system, and improve the education system. It is also important 
for the country to modernise its infrastructure to boost potential output and promote a 
more efficient allocation of resources, and for it to enhance the degree of financial 
development and penetration to bolster long-term growth prospects. Furthermore, it is 
essential to strengthen national policies aimed at enhancing competition in product 
markets, to proceed with the liberalisation of regulated sectors and to manage a 
smooth transition to a digital and greener economy, thereby increasing energy 
efficiency and strengthening energy security. In this context, sustained efforts are 
needed to build up administrative capacity and to further improve the absorption of EU 
funding. With long-term unemployment accounting for a large percentage of total 
unemployment, active labour market policy measures are required to strengthen the 
skill level of the workforce, to promote the economic inclusion of the most vulnerable 
segments of society, and to mitigate the impact of a declining working-age population. 
With regard to macroeconomic imbalances, the European Commission did not select 
Bulgaria for an in-depth review in its Alert Mechanism Report 2025. 
The convergence in banking supervision achieved under the close cooperation 
framework ensures the application of uniform supervisory standards and thus 
contributes to safeguarding financial stability. Following the inclusion of the 
Bulgarian lev in ERM II, the ECB and the Bulgarian National Bank have been working 
together under the close cooperation framework since 1 October 2020. The ECB is 
responsible for the direct supervision of four significant institutions and the common 
procedures for all supervised entities, as well as the oversight of 13 less significant 
institutions. The Bulgarian National Bank has been integrated into the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism and is participating in its structures and networks. With 
regard to the oversight of less significant institutions, which have a domestic market 
share of roughly 30%, the ECB is working closely with national supervisors to further 
harmonise implementation of the rules governing banking supervision, while also 
ensuring that joint supervisory standards are applied consistently across the 
system.151 
Risks stemming from strong credit and house price dynamics are increasing 
but being mitigated by the robustness of the banking system. Given the limited 
spillover effects in Bulgaria from the restrictive monetary policy stance in the euro area 
over the past few years and robust domestic demand in the country, lending activity 
has remained strong, particularly in the household segment (Chart 4.4, panel a), 
alongside sharp increases in house prices (Chart 4.4, panel b). These trends point to a 
risk of overheating in the economy and early signs of a credit/asset price spiral, as 
reflected in estimated real estate overvaluations. To mitigate these risks, the Bulgarian 
National Bank recently activated borrower-based macroprudential measures

alongside the stepwise increase in the countercyclical capital buffer rate, which has 
stood at 2% since 1 October 2023. In addition, the banking sector is well capitalised, 
liquidity buffers are large, and banks’ lending standards generally align with the

4.2 Fiscal developments 
Bulgaria’s general government budget deficit stood at the level of the 3% 
reference value in 2024 and its debt level stood well below the 60% reference 
value. In the reference year 2024 the general government budget recorded a deficit of 
3.0% of GDP, thus standing at the level of the 3% deficit reference value. The general 
government gross debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 24.1%, well below the 60% reference 
value (Table 4.5.2). Compared with the previous year, the general government deficit 
increased by 1.0 percentage point and the debt ratio increased moderately, by 
1.2 percentage points. With regard to other fiscal factors, the deficit ratio stood at the 
level of the ratio of public investment to GDP in 2024. 
Bulgaria is currently not subject to a Council Decision on the existence of an 
excessive deficit. The country has been subject to the preventive arm of the Stability 
and Growth Pact since 2012. It was only once subject to an excessive deficit 
procedure, between 2010 and 2012, while its general government debt has been well 
below the reference value since 2004. During the period in which the general escape 
clause under the Stability and Growth Pact applied (owing to the pandemic and the 
invasion of Ukraine by Russia), the European Commission found, in May 2022, that 
the general government deficit-to-GDP ratio had, in 2021, been above and not close to 
the reference value of 3%, and, in May 2023, that the planned deficit in 2024 was also 
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 122 –
 
Convergence Report, June 2025 
 
54 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
above and not close to the reference value. In both cases, the Commission’s analysis 
suggested that the deficit criterion had not been fulfilled. However, given the high 
uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, the Commission considered that 
at that juncture a decision on whether to place Member States under the excessive 
deficit procedure should not be taken. 
The budget deficit increased in 2024 and remains significantly above its level 
prior to the pandemic. Before the pandemic, Bulgaria’s prudent fiscal policy led to 
significant improvements in its structural balance, which shifted the headline balance 
from a deficit of 1.9% of GDP in 2015 to a surplus of 2.2% of GDP in 2019. As a 
consequence of the pandemic and the government’s fiscal support to buffer its impact, 
the structural balance worsened markedly, resulting in a headline deficit of 4.0% of 
GDP in 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, the budget balance improved by 2.0% of GDP, 
primarily on account of an improvement in the structural balance by 1.2% of GDP. 
However, in 2024 the budget balance deteriorated again by 1.0 percentage point. The 
deterioration in the budget balance in 2024 compared with 2019, i.e. the year before 
the outbreak of the pandemic, was 5.2% of GDP, which was mostly attributable to a 
deterioration in the structural balance by 4.5% of GDP. 
The government debt-to-GDP ratio has remained well below the 60% reference 
value over the past two decades. Prior to the pandemic, the debt ratio had declined 
between 2015 and 2019 by 5.8 percentage points to 20.1% of GDP, mostly owing to 
high primary surpluses and, to a lesser extent, favourable interest-growth differentials. 
After increasing by 4.3% of GDP in 2020 at the start of the pandemic, it then fell by 1.9 
percentage points between 2020 and 2022. This was attributable to favourable 
interest-growth differentials, which compensated somewhat for the debt-increasing 
impact from primary deficits. Between 2022 and 2024 the debt ratio increased again 
by 1.6% of GDP, mostly on account of primary deficits, to a level 4.0% percentage 
points higher than before the pandemic. 
In the presence of a long-standing currency board, the level and structure of 
public debt allow Bulgaria to manage its debt effectively. The share of 
government debt with a short-term maturity has generally been negligible. Taking into 
account the low share of debt with a variable interest rate and the level of the debt 
ratio, fiscal balances are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates. At the same 
time, the proportion of foreign currency-denominated government debt is high (76.1% 
in 2024). However, it is mostly denominated in euro – the anchor currency of 
Bulgaria’s currency board framework. Fiscal balances are thus relatively insensitive to 
changes in exchange rates other than the euro/lev exchange rate, which is fixed under 
the currency board. 
The European Commission’s Spring 2025 Economic Forecast predicts a small 
decrease in the budget deficit and an increasing public debt ratio. According to

expected to decrease to 2.8% of GDP in 2025 and thus fall below the 3% deficit

ratio is projected to rise in 2025, to 25.1% of GDP, and to 27.1% of GDP in 2026. The

projected net expenditure growth in 2025 exceeds Bulgaria’s medium-term 
fiscal-structural plan.152 Bulgaria applied for the national escape clause which would 
allow it to deviate from the net expenditure path when this is due to higher defence 
expenditure. 
Bulgaria has a robust fiscal framework that has helped it to maintain a low debt 
ratio. Bulgaria has a large number of national fiscal rules at the general government 
and subnational levels. They are laid out in the Public Finance Act, which was last 
amended in 2020 as a response to the pandemic. First, the Act sets an objective of a 
balanced or positive general government budget balance and a ceiling for the general 
government deficit at 3% of GDP and for debt at 60% of GDP, in line with the Treaty 
reference values. Second, it sets a medium-term budgetary objective, limiting the 
structural deficit of the general government sector to no more than 0.5% of GDP – or 
1% of GDP if government debt is below 40% of GDP and risks to the long-term 
sustainability of public finances are low – with an escape clause for exceptional 
circumstances, in line with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact before 
its reform in 2024. Third, annual expenditure growth is restricted to the reference 
growth rate of potential GDP, in accordance with the expenditure rule of the pre-reform 
Stability and Growth Pact. Fourth, an additional national deficit rule restricts the deficit 
under the consolidated fiscal programme, calculated on a cash basis, to 3% of GDP, 
but allows larger deficits in exceptional circumstances. Fifth, the expenditure under the 
consolidated fiscal programme is capped at 40% of GDP, excluding EU funds and 
national co-financing. Sixth, the Public Finance Act imposes additional restrictions on 
the budget balance, expenditure growth and debt payments at the municipal level, and 
also includes constraints on the debt of social security funds and other entities. While 
the rules concerning the structural deficit and expenditure growth need adjustment to 
align with the revised European economic governance framework, due attention 
should be paid to ensuring continued fiscal stability. Compliance with the rules is 
monitored by the Fiscal Council, which was established in 2016 in line with EU 
requirements. While its mandate and the quality of its work have been strengthened 
over time, there is still room for improvement regarding the Fiscal Council’s capacity 
and independence. Notable progress has been made in enhancing the capacity of the 
tax administration, leading to increasing tax collection and improved tax compliance, 
though further progress is still desirable to address the still sizeable informal economy. 
Bulgaria faces medium risks to fiscal sustainability over the medium term and 
low risks over the long term. The European Commission’s 2024 Debt Sustainability 
Monitor found that Bulgaria faces medium fiscal sustainability risks over the medium 
term. This assessment is unchanged compared with the 2023 results. While it was 
found that debt, although increasing, would remain under 60% of GDP under all 
scenarios, it was considered to be at medium risk owing to the high uncertainty as 
regards debt dynamics over the next five years, based on historical volatility. Over the 
long term, Bulgaria was found to face low risks, compared with medium risks in the 
2023 report. The assessment reflects decreasing costs of ageing, which in the long 
152  The fiscal-structural plan of Bulgaria was published in February 2025. After assessing the plan, on 12 
May the European Commission recommended to the EU Council that it adopt a recommendation 
endorsing the plan.

term offset the impact of a more demanding initial budgetary position. According to the 
baseline from the 2024 Ageing Report prepared by the Ageing Working Group (AWG) 
of the EU’s Economic Policy Committee, age-related public expenditure is projected to 
increase moderately (by 0.6 percentage points of GDP) over the period 2022-70, from 
a level of 18.2% of GDP in 2022.153 Under the AWG’s risk scenario, the increase in 
costs would be significantly higher, i.e. 3.9 percentage points of GDP, mainly owing to 
a larger rise in healthcare and long-term care spending (by 2.1 percentage points of 
GDP by comparison with the baseline scenario). These projections signal a need for 
further reforms to reinforce the long-term sustainability of public finances. 
Looking ahead, Bulgaria needs to pursue prudent fiscal policies to ensure 
compliance with its net expenditure path. Although the country recorded fiscal 
surpluses prior to the pandemic, its budget balance has deteriorated substantially 
since then. This development has coincided with a period of political instability marked 
by six snap elections between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, to ensure long-term 
sustainability, Bulgaria needs to address spending pressures in a prudent manner and 
maintain a sound fiscal policy. This requires the country to ensure compliance with its 
net expenditure path under the Stability and Growth Pact, while also preserving fiscal 
buffers to mitigate potential adverse shocks. Bulgaria faces substantial delays in the 
implementation of its Recovery and Resilience Plan, largely due to the political 
instability, which risks the loss of funds from the Next Generation EU programme. 
Therefore, it is crucial that the country accelerate the implementation of reforms and 
the execution of key projects. Additionally, capital spending should be increased, with 
a focus on improving its quality and efficiency through enhanced public investment 
management, including the development of a long-term investment strategy. To 
further ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, continued efforts to combat the 
informal economy are necessary to improve tax collection. It will also be vital to 
strengthen the governance and profitability of state-owned enterprises, as well as 
increase the sustainability of the pension system. 
4.3 Exchange rate developments 
The Bulgarian lev participated in ERM II in the two-year reference period from 
20 May 2023 to 19 May 2025. It was included in ERM II at a central rate of 1.95583 
levs per euro with a standard fluctuation band of ±15% in July 2020. Bulgaria joined 
the exchange rate mechanism with its existing currency board in place, as a unilateral 
commitment, thus placing no additional obligations on the ECB. Over the reference 
period the lev did not exhibit any deviation from the central rate (Chart 4.5.3). As 
implied by the currency board arrangement, the Bulgarian National Bank has 
continued to exchange on demand domestic currency against the anchor currency 
(the euro) and vice versa at the fixed rate.

The agreement on participation in ERM II was based on a number of policy 
commitments by the Bulgarian authorities, with the aim of achieving a high 
degree of sustainable economic convergence by the time of the adoption of the 
euro. These commitments relate to implementing specific policy measures pertaining 
to the non-bank financial sector, state-owned enterprises, the insolvency framework, 
and the framework for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism 
(AML/CFT). The ECB and the European Commission have been monitoring the 
effective implementation of Bulgaria’s ERM II post-entry commitments, acting within 
their respective areas of competence as provided for by the Treaties and secondary 
legislation. In its role as the prudential supervisory authority and given its shared 
responsibility for macroprudential policy, the ECB has focused on the implementation 
of the commitments related to the financial sector, i.e. the insolvency and AML/CFT 
frameworks, owing to their importance for the functioning of the financial system, as 
well as for financial integrity and stability. Bulgaria has completed almost all of its 
post-entry commitments and undertaken to deliver on the outstanding points related to 
state-owned enterprises and the insolvency framework reforms. All outstanding points 
are covered in commitments in Bulgaria’s recovery and resilience plan. Regarding 
AML/CFT, while the policy measures envisaged in the post-entry commitments have 
been implemented, further progress is needed to address remaining shortcomings. In 
particular, Bulgaria is encouraged to accelerate its efforts to fulfil the elements of the 
action plan that was adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) after Bulgaria 
was placed on the FATF’s “grey list” of jurisdictions under increased monitoring in 
October 2023. 
The HICP-based real effective exchange rate of the Bulgarian lev has 
appreciated over the past ten years (Chart 4.5.4). This appreciation reflected 
developments in the nominal effective exchange rate. In the wake of Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine in late February 2022, the relatively high level of inflation in Bulgaria was a 
factor in the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the lev, but the effect 
was partially reversed by the moderation in inflation later that year. This indicator 
should be interpreted with caution, as Bulgaria is subject to a process of economic 
convergence, which complicates any long-term assessment of real exchange rate 
developments. 
Bulgaria’s combined current and capital account balance has mostly remained 
in surplus over the past ten years and the country’s net foreign liabilities have 
declined markedly (Table 4.5.3). From 2015 to 2019 the combined current and 
capital account balance increased, primarily reflecting a substantial reduction in the 
goods deficit as a result of the export-led recovery. However, a deficit was recorded in 
2021 and 2022 – two years characterised by high volatility owing to the pandemic and 
Russia’s war against Ukraine. This was followed by a return to a surplus in 2023. Over 
the period 2020-24 the adjustment in the balance of payments was associated with an 
increase in the trade deficit. Gross external debt decreased further, falling from 62.6% 
of GDP in 2020 to 47.4% in 2024. At the same time, the country’s net international 
investment position, largely consisting of foreign direct investment, continued to 
improve, rising from -23.4% of GDP in 2020 to -3.7% of GDP in 2024 (Table 4.1), on 
account of a further accumulation of reserve assets. Fiscal and structural policies 
continue to be important for supporting external sustainability and the competitiveness

of the economy, especially in a volatile environment characterised by geopolitical, 
trade policy and commodity price shocks. Given the country’s limited direct export 
exposure to the United States, the macroeconomic impact of the recent disruptions in 
trade flows as a result of import tariffs is likely to materialise mainly via Bulgaria’s 
European trading partners. This indirect impact reflects the integration of the Bulgarian 
economy into the industrial supply chain, especially through intermediate products in 
the automotive industry. 
The Bulgarian economy is well integrated with the euro area through trade and 
investment linkages. In 2024 exports of goods and services to the euro area 
constituted 45.7% of total exports, with the corresponding figure for imports standing 
at 40.5%. In the same year the share of the euro area in Bulgaria’s stock of inward 
direct investment stood at 64.0% and its share in the country’s stock of portfolio 
investment liabilities was 75.8%. The share of Bulgaria’s stock of foreign assets 
invested in the euro area amounted to 43.9% in the case of direct investment and 
53.8% for portfolio investment in 2024. Bulgaria’s economy is also characterised by a 
high degree of euroisation. Around 75% of public debt, as well as a significant share of 
private debt, is denominated in euro, which mirrors the currency composition of 
household savings and of the liquid assets of non-financial corporations in Bulgaria.

4.4 Long-term interest rate developments 
Over the reference period from May 2024 to April 2025, long-term interest rates 
in Bulgaria declined and stood at 3.9% on average, below the 5.1% reference 
value for the interest rate convergence criterion (Chart 4.5.5). 
Long-term interest rates in Bulgaria had mostly followed a declining trend from 
2015 until 2022, when they increased sharply before subsequently stabilising. 
The declining trend in the first part of the past decade was attributable to domestic and 
global cyclical factors. These included spillovers from low interest rates in the euro 
area, Bulgarian banks’ continued demand for government debt securities, a high 
private savings rate and the effect of global trade tensions on growth expectations. In 
the period 2020-21 the impact of the pandemic on global and domestic economic 
activity and inflation drove long-term interest rates in Bulgaria down to a historically 
low level of 0.1% in mid-2021. Long-term interest rates increased significantly from 
2022 in a context of mounting domestic and global inflationary pressures. Political 
uncertainty – which has seen seven general elections held since 2021 – may also 
have contributed to a sharp increase of around 200 basis points in long-term interest 
rates over this period. Long-term interest rates in Bulgaria have stabilised over the 
past two years and stood at 3.9% in April 2025, 10 basis points below the level in April 
2023 (Chart 4.5.5). However, developments in long-term interest rates in Bulgaria 
must be interpreted with caution, as the bond used to derive the relevant interest rate 
has not been traded in the market since 10 January 2024, reflecting the abundant 
liquidity in the banking system. Since April 2023 the default risk on long-term Bulgarian 
debt, as measured by ten-year credit default swap spreads, has declined significantly 
to around 115 basis points as the negative impact of domestic political uncertainty 
gradually subsided. Bulgaria’s government debt is rated investment grade by all three 
main rating agencies (Moody’s: Baa1; S&P: BBB; Fitch: BBB). 
The long-term interest rate differential of Bulgarian government bonds vis-à-vis 
the euro area average stood at 0.9 percentage points in April 2025. Over the 
period 2016-17, Bulgarian long-term interest rates gradually converged towards the 
euro area average rate with corresponding maturity (Chart 4.5.6). From 2018 the 
differential remained quite low – also spending some time in negative territory – until 
March 2023, when it turned significantly positive. In April 2025 it stood at 
0.9 percentage points (1.4 percentage points vis-à-vis the euro area AAA yield). 
Capital markets in Bulgaria are smaller and much less developed than those in 
the euro area (Table 4.5.4). Over the past ten years there have been only a few 
indications of a deepening of capital markets. Stock market capitalisation, as a 
percentage of GDP, has declined from an average of 17.8% over the period 2015-19 
to 8.4% in 2024. At the same time, market-based debt financing of domestic monetary 
financial institutions (MFIs) has increased slightly since the period 2015-19 to stand at 
2.0% of GDP in 2024. The access of non-financial corporations in Bulgaria to the 
corporate debt market seems to have declined, as outstanding debt securities issued 
by this sector accounted for 1.8% of GDP in 2024, 1.4 percentage points lower than in

the period 2015-19. In 2024 the Bulgarian banking system’s exposure to euro area 
banks in terms of funding increased in comparison with the average over the period 
2015-19. Euro area banks’ claims on Bulgarian banks rose to 6.4% of the latter’s total 
liabilities in 2024, up from an average level of 3.3% over the period 2015-19. 
The degree of financial intermediation by banks remains quite low in Bulgaria 
compared with the euro area average, although it is comparable to that of peer 
countries in the region. MFI credit to non-government residents stood at 51.9% of 
GDP in 2024, 1.6 percentage points below its average for the period 2015-19. As at 
the third quarter of 2024 – the latest date for which data are available – foreign-owned 
banks continued to play a major role in the banking system in Bulgaria, accounting for 
almost 73% of total banking assets. The banking system is largely funded by resident 
private non-financial sector deposits. The banking system’s assets vis-à-vis the 
non-financial private sector were dominated by loans, 80% of which were 
denominated in local currency.

Convergence Report, June 2025 65 
ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
5 Statistical methodology of convergence 
indicators 
The examination of the convergence process is highly dependent on the quality 
and integrity of the underlying statistics; the compilation and reporting of 
statistics, particularly government finance statistics (GFS), must not be subject 
to any political or other external interference. Member States are invited to 
consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a matter of priority, to ensure that 
a proper system of checks and balances is in place when compiling these statistics 
and to apply high standards with respect to governance and quality in the domain of 
statistics. 
National statistical authorities in each Member State and the EU statistical 
authority within the European Commission (Eurostat) should enjoy 
professional independence and ensure that European statistics are impartial 
and of a high quality. This is in line with the principles laid down in Article 338(2) of 
the Treaty, the Regulation on European statistics154 and the European Statistics Code 
of Practice155. Article 2(1) of the Regulation on European statistics states that the 
development, production and dissemination of European statistics shall be governed 
by the following statistical principles: a) professional independence, b) impartiality, 
c) objectivity, d) reliability, e) statistical confidentiality, and f) cost effectiveness.
Pursuant to Article 11 of the Regulation, these statistical principles are elaborated
further in the European Statistics Code of Practice.
Against this background, this chapter reviews the quality and integrity of the 
convergence indicators in terms of the underlying statistics. It provides 
information on the statistical methodology of the convergence indicators, as well as on 
the compliance of the underlying statistics with the standards necessary for an 
appropriate assessment of the convergence process. 
5.1 Institutional features relating to the quality of statistics for 
the assessment of the convergence process 
The governance of the European Statistical System (ESS) has been 
progressively improved, in particular with the adoption of the European 
154  Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on 
European statistics and repealing Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office 
of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and Council 
Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European 
Communities (OJ L 87, 31.3.2009, p. 164), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/3018 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2024 (OJ L 2024/3018, 6.12.2024). 
155  The European Statistics Code of Practice was endorsed by the European Commission in its 
Recommendation of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and 
Community statistical authorities (COM(2005) 217 final), and revised by the European Statistical System 
Committee in September 2011 and November 2017.

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
Statistics Code of Practice in 2005. In the specific context of the EU fiscal 
surveillance system and of the excessive deficit procedure (EDP), Council Regulation 
(EU) No 679/2010156 granted Eurostat new competences for the regular monitoring 
and verification of public finance data, which it exercises by conducting more in-depth 
dialogue visits to Member States and by extending such visits to public entities 
supplying upstream public finance data to the national statistical institutes (NSIs). 
Furthermore, the legislative package of six legal texts adopted in 2011 to 
strengthen the economic governance structure of the euro area and the EU as a 
whole requires the compilation of high-quality statistical information, which 
needs to be produced under robust quality management.157 In this context, the 
European Statistics Code of Practice was revised in September 2011 in order to 
distinguish between the principles to be implemented by ESS members and the 
principles relating to the institutional environment that are to be implemented by 
Member State governments. In 2017 it was revised again in order to emphasise that 
the NSIs and Eurostat coordinate all activities involved in the development, production 
and dissemination of European statistics (produced in accordance with the Regulation 
on European statistics) at the level of their national statistical systems and the ESS 
respectively.158 
In 2015 the Regulation on European statistics159 was amended in order to, 
among other things, clarify that the principle of professional independence of 
NSIs applies unconditionally. Statistics must indeed be developed, produced and 
disseminated in an independent manner, free of any pressure from political or interest 
groups or from EU or national authorities, and existing institutional frameworks must 
not be allowed to restrict this principle. 
Lastly, it is necessary to assure the independence of other statistical 
authorities responsible for the compilation of European statistics (e.g. 
ministries of finance). Other statistical authorities’ responsibility for the publication of 
statistics needs to be clearly identified in order to distinguish statistical releases from 
political statements. In Bulgaria, the Ministry of Finance compiles quarterly 
government debt data, while the NSI compiles annual government debt data. The 
156  Council Regulation (EU) No 679/2010 of 26 July 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 as 
regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure (OJ L 198, 
30.7.2010, p. 1). 
157  On 13 December 2011 the reinforced Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) entered into force with a new set 
of rules for economic and fiscal surveillance. These measures, known as the “six-pack”, consist of five 
regulations and one directive proposed by the European Commission and approved in October 2010 by 
all 27 Member States at the time and the European Parliament. 
158  European statistics are developed, produced and disseminated by both the ESS and the European 
System of Central Banks (ESCB) but under separate legal frameworks reflecting their respective 
governance structures. The members of the ESCB are not involved in the production of European 
statistics pursuant to the Regulation on European statistics. However, with a view to minimising the 
reporting burden and guaranteeing the coherence necessary to produce European statistics, the ESS 
and the ESCB cooperate closely, while complying with the statistical principles set out in Article 2(1) of 
the Regulation on European statistics. Given that some European statistics may be compiled by national 
central banks in their capacity as members of the ESCB, the NSIs and the national central banks also 
cooperate closely under national arrangements with a view to ensuring the necessary cooperation 
between the ESS and the ESCB and to guaranteeing the production of complete and coherent European 
statistics. 
159  Regulation (EU) 2015/759 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 amending 
Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics (OJ L 123, 19.5.2015, p. 90).

institutional responsibilities for the compilation of EDP data and GFS are shown in 
Table 5.1. Although the independence of the compilers at the Bulgarian Ministry of 
Finance is not guaranteed by law, the monitoring and quality assurance of the EDP 
data and GFS compiled by the Ministry of Finance form part of the coordination role of 
the NSI. 
Table 5.1 
Quality and integrity of convergence statistics 
Institutional features relating to the quality and integrity of the statistics used in assessing the convergence process 
Legal independence of the national 
statistical institute (NSI) 
Under Article 2(2) of the Law on Statistics1), statistics are based on the principles of 
professional independence, impartiality, objectivity, reliability, statistical confidentiality and cost 
effectiveness. Under Article 8 of the Law on Statistics, the President of the NSI is appointed by 
a decision of the Council of Ministers. The term of office is fixed (seven years; reappointment is 
possible, only once). 
Administrative supervision and 
budget autonomy 
The NSI has the status of a state agency and is directly subordinated to the Council of 
Ministers. It has budget autonomy on the basis of an annual amount assigned from the state 
budget. 
Legal mandate for data collection The Law on Statistics determines the main principles of data collection. 
Legal provisions regarding statistical 
confidentiality 
Under Articles 25 to 27a of the Law on Statistics, the confidentiality of the statistical data is 
assured. 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation 
Compliance with legal minimum 
standards 
Eurostat made a compliance monitoring visit in September 2024 and published a report in 
December that year confirming that the methods used for producing the HICP are satisfactory.2) 
There were no major instances of non-compliance with the HICP methodology. 
Other issues Eurostat considered the representativeness of the HICP to be generally appropriate.

Institution responsible for the 
compilation of statistics 
The NSI compiles the non-financial and annual financial accounts of government, as well as 
annual government debt. The Ministry of Finance compiles quarterly government debt and the 
national central bank compiles the quarterly financial accounts of government.

2) The full report on the findings and recommendations of Eurostat’s compliance monitoring of the Bulgarian HICP is available on its 
website. 
5.2 HICP inflation 
This section considers the methodology and quality of the statistics underlying 
the measurement of price developments, specifically the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP was developed for the purpose of assessing 
convergence in terms of price stability on a comparable basis. It is published for all EU 
Member States by Eurostat.160 The HICP covering the euro area as a whole has been 
the main measure of price developments for the monetary policy of the ECB since 
January 1999. 
Article 1 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria (annexed to the 
Treaties) requires price convergence to be measured by means of the 
consumer price index (CPI) on a comparable basis, taking into account 
160  See Eurostat’s website for details on the HICP legislative framework. Eurostat has also published 
recommendations and a methodological manual.

differences in national definitions. The framework regulation introduced to 
establish HICPs, Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95161, was adopted in October 
1995 and subsequently replaced by Regulation (EU) 2016/792162, which entered into 
force in June 2016. The HICPs have also been harmonised on the basis of EU Council 
and European Parliament regulations. They use common standards for the coverage 
of the items, the territory and the population included (all these elements are major 
reasons for differences between national CPIs). Common standards have also been 
established in several other areas, for example the treatment of new goods and 
services. 
The HICPs use annually updated expenditure weights (or, until 2011, less 
frequent updates if this did not have a significant effect on the index) and cover 
all goods and services included in household final monetary consumption 
expenditure. The latter is derived from the national accounts domestic concept of 
household final consumption expenditure but excludes owner-occupied housing. The 
prices observed are the prices households actually pay for goods and services in 
monetary transactions and thus include all taxes (minus subsidies) on products, e.g. 
VAT and excise duties. Expenditure on health, education and social services is 
covered to the extent that it is financed (directly or through private insurance) by 
households and not reimbursed by the government. The “HICP – administered prices” 
includes only prices which are directly set or significantly influenced by the 
government, including national regulators. It is based on a common definition and 
compilation, and is published by Eurostat. 
Eurostat must ensure that the statistical practices used to compile national 
HICPs comply with HICP methodological requirements and that good practices 
in the field of consumer price indices are being followed. Eurostat carries out 
compliance monitoring visits and publishes its findings in information notes made 
available on its website. 
5.3 Government finance statistics 
This section describes the methodology and quality of the statistics used to 
measure fiscal developments. GFS are based mainly on national accounts 
concepts as defined in the ESA 2010163 and Commission Regulation (EU) 
No 220/2014164. They refer to the institutional sector “general government” as defined 
in the ESA 2010. This comprises central government, state government (in Member 
161  Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonized indices of consumer 
prices (OJ L 257, 27.10.1995, p. 1).

States with a federal structure), local government and social security funds. It typically 
does not include public corporations. 
The general government deficit (-)/surplus (+) is equal to the ESA 2010 item “net 
lending (+)/net borrowing (-)”, which in turn is equal to “total revenue” minus 
“total expenditure”. The primary government deficit/surplus is the government 
deficit/surplus excluding interest expenditure. 
The general government debt is the sum of the outstanding gross liabilities at 
nominal value (face value) in currency and deposits, debt securities (e.g. 
government bills, notes and bonds) and loans. It excludes financial derivatives, 
such as swaps165, as well as trade credits166 and other liabilities not represented by a 
financial document, such as overpaid tax advances. It also excludes contingent 
liabilities, such as government guarantees and pension commitments. While 
government debt is a gross concept in the sense that neither financial nor 
non-financial assets are deducted from liabilities, it is consolidated within the general 
government sector and therefore does not include government debt held by other 
government units. 
Government deficit and debt ratios are expressed as a percentage of GDP at 
current market prices. 
5.3.1 Data source 
The national central banks (NCBs) provide the ECB with detailed GFS data 
under the ECB’s GFS Guideline167. Although the Guideline is only legally binding for 
the euro area NCBs, the non-euro area EU NCBs also transmit GFS data to the ECB 
by the same deadlines and using the same procedures. The Guideline lays down 
requirements for the transmission of annual data with detailed breakdowns of annual 
revenue and expenditure and the deficit-debt adjustment. In addition, it requests 
figures on general government debt with breakdowns by instrument, by initial and 
residual maturity and by holder. 
5.3.2 Methodological issues 
GFS must comply with the ESA 2010 and reflect decisions and guidelines 
issued by Eurostat for specific cases involving the general government sector. 
The borderline classification cases between the financial, non-financial and general 
government sectors continue to be examined closely by Eurostat and national 
165  However, on the basis of a Eurostat guidance note released in 2008, lump sums received by government 
under off-market interest rate swaps are treated as government loans. 
166  A 2012 Eurostat decision stipulates that trade credits that are refinanced without recourse to the original 
holder and trade credits that are renegotiated beyond the simple extension of the initial maturity need to 
be reclassified as loans and are thus included in the EDP general government debt.

statistical compilers and may lead to further reclassifications and changes in the EDP 
and GFS data. 
5.4 Exchange rates 
Article 3 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria defines what is meant 
by the criterion on participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the 
European Monetary System. The bilateral exchange rates of the Member States’ 
currencies vis-à-vis the euro are daily reference rates recorded by the ECB at 
14:15 CET and subsequently published on the ECB’s website.168 Nominal and real 
effective exchange rates (EERs) are constructed by applying trade weights (based on 
a geometric weighting) to the bilateral nominal and real exchange rates of the Member 
States’ currencies vis-à-vis the currencies of 41 trading partners. Both nominal and 
real EER statistics are published by the ECB. 
5.5 Long-term interest rates 
Article 4 of Protocol (No 13) on the convergence criteria requires interest rates 
to be measured on the basis of long-term government bonds or comparable 
securities, taking into account differences in national definitions. While Article 5 
assigns the responsibility for providing the statistical data for the application of the 
Protocol to the European Commission, the ECB, given its expertise in the area, assists 
in this process by defining representative long-term interest rates and collecting the 
data from the NCBs for transmission to the Commission. This is a continuation of the 
work carried out by the European Monetary Institute as part of the preparations for 
Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union in close cooperation with the 
Commission. The conceptual work resulted in the definition of seven key features to 
be considered in the calculation of long-term interest rates, as presented in Table 5.2. 
Long-term interest rates refer to bonds denominated in national currency. 
168  Since 1 July 2016 the reference rates have been published at around 16:00 CET. For details, see “ECB 
introduces changes to euro foreign exchange reference rates”, press release, ECB, 7 December 2015.

Statistical framework for defining long-term interest rates for the purpose of assessing 
convergence 
Concept Recommendation 
Bond issuer The bond should be issued by the central government. 
Maturity As close as possible to ten years’ residual maturity. Any replacement of bonds should minimise 
maturity drift; the structural liquidity of the market must be considered. 
Coupon effects No direct adjustment. 
Taxation Gross of tax. 
Choice of bonds The selected bonds should be sufficiently liquid. This requirement should determine the choice 
between benchmark or sample approaches, depending on national market conditions. 
Yield formula The “redemption yield” formula should be applied. 
Aggregation Where there is more than one bond in the sample, a simple average of the yields should be used to 
produce the representative rate. 
5.6 Other factors 
The last paragraph of Article 140(1) of the Treaty states that the reports of the 
European Commission and the ECB shall take account of, in addition to the 
four main criteria, the results of the integration of markets, the situation and 
development of the national balance of payments and an examination of the 
development of unit labour costs and other price indices. Whereas, for the four 
main criteria, Protocol (No 13) stipulates that the Commission will provide the data to 
be used for the assessment of compliance and describes those statistics in more 
detail, it makes no reference to the provision of statistics for these “other factors”. 
With regard to the results of the integration of markets, two sets of indicators 
are used. These are i) statistics on financial development and integration referring to 
the structure of the financial system,169 and ii) statistics on financial and non-financial 
integration with the euro area.170 
The data covering the structure of the financial system are provided by the 
NCBs. The indicators concerning the debt securities issued by resident financial 
corporations (monetary financial institutions (MFIs) excluding the NCB and 
non-monetary financial corporations) and non-financial corporations are compiled in 
accordance with the methodology set out in Guideline (EU) 2022/971171. The indicator 
relating to stock market capitalisation refers to listed shares issued by resident 
corporations following the methodology given in the same Guideline. The indicators 
concerning MFI credit to residents and claims of euro area MFIs on resident MFIs are 
based on available data collected by the ECB as part of the MFI balance sheet 
169  Debt securities issued by resident corporations, stock market capitalisation, MFI credit to 
non-government residents and claims of euro area MFIs on resident MFIs. 
170  External trade and investment position with the euro area.

statistics collection framework. The data are obtained from the countries under review 
and, for the latter indicator, also from the euro area countries covered by Regulation 
(EU) No 2021/379172. Historical data are compiled by the relevant NCBs, where 
appropriate. For the indicators mentioned in this paragraph, the statistical data relating 
to the euro area cover the countries that had adopted the euro at the time to which the 
statistics relate. 
Balance of payments and international investment position statistics are 
compiled in accordance with the concepts and definitions laid down in the sixth 
edition of the International Monetary Fund’s Balance of Payments and 
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) and with guidance provided 
by the ECB in its Guideline on external statistics173,174 and by Eurostat. The 
Convergence Report examines developments in the current account (goods, services, 
primary income and secondary income) and the capital account; the sum of the 
balances of these two accounts corresponds to the net lending/net borrowing of the 
total economy. In addition, developments in the main components of the financial 
account are presented together with the net international investment position and 
gross external debt of each country. Exports and imports of goods and services are 
presented vis-à-vis both the rest of the world and the euro area. Direct and portfolio 
investment assets and liabilities with the euro area are also reported. Forecasted data 
are taken from the European Commission’s economic forecasts.175 
The Convergence Report also looks at the development of unit labour costs and 
other price indices. With regard to producer price indices, these data refer to 
domestic sales of total industry excluding construction. The statistics are collected on 
a harmonised basis under the EU Regulation on European business statistics176. 
Statistics on unit labour costs (calculated as compensation per employee divided by 
GDP chain-linked volumes per hours worked) are derived from data provided under 
the ESA 2010 transmission programme.

6 Examination of the compatibility of 
Bulgarian legislation with the Treaties 
6.1 Compatibility of national legislation 
The following legislation forms the legal basis for Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) and its operations: 
• the Bulgarian Constitution,177
• the Law on Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) published on
13 February 2024 (hereinafter the “Law on BNB”).178 The Law on BNB enters
into force and repeals and replaces the previous Law on Българска народна
банка (Bulgarian National Bank)179 as of the date stipulated in the Council
Decision on the adoption by the Republic of Bulgaria of the euro, adopted in
accordance with Article 140(2) of the Treaty, and in the Council Regulation,
adopted in accordance with Article 140(3) of the Treaty. There are no additional
conditions for the entry into force of the Law on BNB.
The Law on counter-corruption180 applies to public office holders. 
6.2 Independence of the NCB 
With regard to the independence of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank), the Law on BNB, the Law on counter-corruption and the Bulgarian Constitution 
have been examined. 
6.2.1 Institutional independence 
Article 6 of the Law on BNB prohibits European Union institutions, bodies, offices or 
agencies, the Council of Ministers or the governments of other EU Member States, as 
well as any other bodies and institutions from giving instructions to Българска 
народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), the Governor or the members of the 
Governing Council. This provision is in line with Article 130 of the Treaty and Article 7 
of the Statute of the ESCB.181 
Article 99 of the Bulgarian Constitution governs the formation of the government. 
Article 99(5) provides that if no agreement is reached on the formation of a 
177  Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, Darjaven vestnik issue 56, 13.7.1991.

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
government, the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, following consultations with the 
parliamentary groups and acting on a motion by the caretaker prime 
minister-designate, shall appoint a caretaker cabinet, and shall schedule new 
elections within two months. A caretaker prime minister shall be appointed from 
among the Chairperson of the National Assembly, the Governor or a Deputy Governor 
of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), the President or a 
Vice-President of the Bulgarian National Audit Office, and the Ombudsman or a 
deputy thereof. In principle, such a possible appointment of a Governor or a Deputy 
Governor, entailing the interruption of their term of office, risks compromising the 
independent exercise of the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred 
upon the NCB. An NCB Governor or Deputy Governor who is appointed as a caretaker 
prime minister on an ad hoc basis and resigns from his or her position as NCB 
Governor or Deputy Governor when accepting this position does not run such a risk. 
However, Article 99 of the Bulgarian Constitution seems to be unprecedented insofar 
as it establishes a permanent regime that envisages the temporary appointment of a 
Governor or a Deputy Governor as a caretaker prime minister. Such regime may 
expose the Governor or Deputy Governor to political leverage and influence involving 
serious conflicts of interest.182 In particular, in case of a temporary interruption of the 
term of office, the risk may arise that the Governor or Deputy Governor takes stances 
as caretaker prime minister that are incompatible with the stance of the NCB, before 
going back to their position as Governor or Deputy Governor, following which conflicts 
arise with previous stances that they may have taken as caretaker prime minister.183  
Pursuant to Article 130 TFEU, when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks 
and duties conferred upon them by the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB, 
members of the decision-making bodies of the NCBs must not seek or take 
instructions from Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, from any government 
of a Member State or from any other body. Furthermore, the governments of the 
Member States undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the 
members of the decision-making bodies of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. 
It follows from Article 130 TFEU that a member of an NCB’s decision-making body 
cannot at the same time assume the function of a member of a national government, in 
particular not as prime minister. Otherwise, the independent exercise of the powers 
and carrying out of the tasks and duties, in which the Governor or a Deputy Governor 
of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) can take an independent 
stance which may be different to that of the government, is logically not conceivable. In 
this regard, it is imperative that, once appointed, the Governor or Deputy Governor of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), as caretaker prime minister is 
required to fully respect the institutional independence of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) and its decision-making bodies in compliance with Article 
130 TFEU.184 In the light of the requirement to independently exercise the powers and 
carry out the tasks and duties conferred upon the NCB by the Treaties and the Statute 
of the ESCB, as laid down in Article 130 TFEU, the risk that the Governor or Deputy

Governor takes stances as caretaker prime minister that are incompatible with the 
stance of the Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) would only be 
sufficiently mitigated by requiring the Governor or Deputy Governor to resign when 
appointed as caretaker prime minister, in order to exclude the materialisation of this 
risk.185 
On 29 May 2024 and 5 June 2024, the ECB was consulted on a draft amendment to 
the Law on BNB, which aimed to reflect these principles.186 The ECB welcomed the 
express stipulation in the draft amendment that in the event that the Governor or a 
Deputy Governor explicitly consents to be appointed as a caretaker prime minister, he 
or she must submit their resignation as Governor or Deputy Governor. The ECB also 
welcomed the provision in the draft amendment that, where the Governor or a Deputy 
Governor is appointed as a caretaker prime minister, their duties as Governor or 
Deputy Governor, as the case may be, are terminated with their appointment as a 
caretaker prime minister, since this increases legal certainty and enhances clarity as 
to the point in time at which the resignation becomes legally effective.187 On 21 March 
2025, the National Assembly adopted this draft amendment.188 
6.2.2 Personal independence 
Article 15(1) and (2) of the Law on BNB lists the grounds on which members of the 
Governing Council may be relieved from office. Article 15(1) provides that the National 
Assembly may relieve the Governor from office in accordance with Article 14.2 of the 
Statute of the ESCB. Article 15(2) provides that other members of the Governing 
Council may be relieved from office if they no longer fulfil the conditions required for 
the performance of their duties or if they have been found guilty of serious misconduct 
in accordance with Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB. Article 15(1) and (2) of the 
Law on BNB complies with Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB.189 
In 2023, Article 98(1) of the Law on counter-corruption replaced Article 80(1) of the 
Law on counter corruption and unlawfully acquired assets forfeiture, which had 
replaced Article 33(1) of the Law on the prevention of conflicts of interests, providing 
that the establishment of a conflict of interest by means of an enforceable legal act is a 
ground for relieving the Governor, Deputy Governors and the other members of the 
Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) from 
office, unless otherwise provided for in the Constitution, the Statute of the ESCB or 
special legislation. Article 98(2) of the Law on counter-corruption provides that the 
relief from office must follow the procedure established in the relevant laws. It is 
understood that in the case of the Governor, Deputy Governors and the other 
members of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank) this refers to Article 15(1) and (2) of the Law on BNB and that this reference

entails that Article 98(1) of the Law on counter-corruption cannot apply in relation to 
the Governor or other members of the Governing Council of Българска народна 
банка (Bulgarian National Bank) because the wording of Article 98(1) of the Law on 
counter-corruption ensures that the establishment of a conflict of interest in 
accordance with that Law will not be a ground for removal from office of a senior public 
office holder where it is otherwise provided for in special legislation, such as the Law 
on BNB.190 
Article 15(3) of the Law on BNB establishes that the grounds for relieving a Deputy 
Governor or another member of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) other than the Governor from office must be established by 
decision of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank). In this context, the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank) must assess whether the Deputy Governor or a member of the 
Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) other than 
the Governor fulfils the conditions for the performance of his or her duties and/or 
whether he or she has been guilty of serious misconduct in the light of Article 14.2 of 
the Statute of the ESCB. Such decisions are adopted according to a procedure 
determined by the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank) and have the immediate effect of suspending the members concerned 
from the exercise of their duties. 
The decisions are subject to appeal before Върховния административен съд (the 
Supreme Administrative Court) within 7 days and the Supreme Administrative Court 
has 14 days to issue a final ruling on an appeal. The final ruling of the Supreme 
Administrative Court on an appeal is sent to the national authority, which has the 
competence to relieve the members of the Governing Council of Българска народна 
банка (Bulgarian National Bank) from office. The final ruling is binding on the 
appointing authority under Article 13 of the Law on BNB. The ECB understands that 
Article 15(3) of the Law on BNB aims to ensure that within the administrative 
procedure for dismissal of any member of the decision-making bodies of Българска 
народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) other than the Governor, it is possible to 
request a review by national courts of the decision of the Governing Council of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) establishing the grounds for 
relieving a Deputy Governor or another member of the Governing Council of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) other than the Governor from 
office. The judicial review of such a decision may lead to its annulment. The annulment 
of a decision of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank) establishing the grounds for relieving a Deputy Governor or another 
member of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank) other than the Governor from office precludes the adoption of a decision by the 
appointing authority to dismiss the relevant member of the Governing Council of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank). In addition, the ECB 
understands that when deciding on the dismissal, the appointing authority cannot 
consider and adopt additional grounds for dismissal that were not established in the 
190  See paragraph 3.1 of Opinion CON/2021/2 and paragraph 3.1.4 of Opinion CON/2022/45.

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
decision of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank). The ECB further understands that, in accordance with general administrative 
law, an appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court could suspend the 
application of the decision of the Governing Council of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank). Based on the above understanding, Article 15(3) of the 
Law on BNB is consistent with Article 130 of the Treaty and with the Statute of the 
ESCB.191 
Article 13(1) and (2) of the Law on BNB, which replaced Article 12(1) and (2) of the 
previous Law on BNB, provides for the National Assembly’s powers to elect the 
Governor and the Deputy Governors of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank). The ECB notes that any proper election or appointment of members of 
an NCB’s decision-making body must enable them to assume office following their 
election. Once elected or appointed, the Governor and the other members of the 
Governing Council of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) may not 
be relieved from office under conditions other than those mentioned in Article 14.2 of 
the Statute of the ESCB, even if they have not yet taken up their duties. 
As noted above, Article 99(5) of the Bulgarian Constitution provides that the Governor 
or a Deputy Governor of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) may be 
appointed by the President of the Republic of Bulgaria as a caretaker prime minister 
for a period of two months. Pursuant to Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, a 
Governor may be relieved from office only if he or she no longer fulfils the conditions 
required for the performance of his or her duties or if he or she has been guilty of 
serious misconduct. Consequently, the appointment of the Governor of Българска 
народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) as a caretaker prime minister may not 
amount to relief from office without the existence of such a ground. It is understood 
that the appointment of the Governor of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank) as caretaker prime minister is subject to the acceptance of the 
appointment by the Governor of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank).192 Based on this understanding that the appointment of the Governor of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) as a caretaker prime minister 
presupposes his or her acceptance, the appointment would not amount to relief from 
office. In such a situation, there is no need for the protection of the personal 
independence of the Governor of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank) by the mechanism of Article 14.2 of the Statute of the ESCB.193 
191  See paragraph 3.2 of Opinion CON/2022/45. 
192  In the light of the requirements flowing from Article 130 TFEU as to the independence of members of 
decision-making bodies of NCBs other than the Governor, it is understood that the appointment of a 
Deputy Governor of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) as caretaker prime minister is 
also subject to the acceptance of the appointment by the Deputy Governor of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank). See paragraph 2.3.2 of Opinion CON/2024/23. 
193  In this context, it is noted that any provision in Bulgarian law governing the replacement of the Governor 
of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), in particular any future amendment to the Law 
on BNB seeking to implement Article 99(5) of the Bulgarian Constitution, cannot mandate the 
appointment of another person as Governor for only two months. In accordance with Article 14.2, first 
subparagraph, of the Statute of the ESCB the term of office of a Governor of an NCB must be no less 
than five years. See Chapter 2.2.3 on “Independence on NCBs”, Section on “Minimum term of office for 
Governors”, Opinion CON/2018/23 and paragraph 2.3.3 of Opinion CON/2024/23.

6.3 Confidentiality 
Article 4 of the Law on BNB provides that, without prejudice to Article 37 of the Statute 
of the ESCB, Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) may not disclose 
or transmit to other persons any information related to the ESCB, nor any information 
obtained that constitutes a banking, professional, commercial or other legally 
protected secret of the banks and the other participants in monetary and credit 
transactions. Article 24(1) of the Law on BNB provides that, without prejudice to Article 
37 of the Statute of the ESCB, the employees of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) shall respect confidentiality concerning negotiations, deals 
contracted, the amount of assets on customers’ deposits and their transactions, and 
information received by Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), as well 
as any circumstances concerning the activities of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) and its customers, which constitute business, banking, 
professional, commercial or other legally protected secrets, even after termination of 
their employment relationship. Under Article 37 of the Statute of the ESCB, 
professional secrecy is an ESCB-wide matter, which is duly acknowledged in Article 4 
and Article 24(1) of the Law on BNB. 
6.4 Monetary financing and privileged access 
In past Convergence Reports the ECB considered that certain provisions of the Law 
on BNB arising from the particularities of the currency-board regime were incompliant 
with the monetary financing prohibition. The Law on BNB adopted in 2024 which 
enters into force on the date stipulated in the Council Decision on the adoption by the 
Republic of Bulgaria of the euro, has repealed those provisions. 
Pursuant to the Law on credit institutions,196 Българска народна банка (Bulgarian 
National Bank) operates a central credit register (Article 56) and a bank account 
register (Article 56a). The costs of obtaining information from these registers by 
government and judicial authorities are to be borne by the State budget. In past 
Convergence Reports the ECB considered that in order to further ensure compatibility 
with the prohibition of monetary financing, the Law on credit institutions would benefit 
from a limitation of the liability of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank)

in relation to the operation of the two registers.197 The provisions of both Articles 56 
and 56a have been amended to waive the liability of Българска народна банка 
(Bulgarian National Bank) in relation to the operation of the two registers. Instead of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank), the State will be liable for 
damages resulting from the operation of the two registers in accordance with the 
general regime for State liability.198 This makes the rules compliant with the prohibition 
of monetary financing. 
6.5 Legal integration of the NCB into the Eurosystem 
In past Convergence Reports the ECB considered, with regard to legal integration of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) into the Eurosystem, that the 
Law on BNB needed to be adapted in several respects. The Law on BNB, which was 
adopted in 2024, addresses these elements, as set out below. 
6.5.1 Tasks 
6.5.1.1 Monetary policy 
Article 2(1) and Article 17, points 3 and 4, and Articles 37, 38, 39 and 43 of the Law on 
BNB, which provide for the powers of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National 
Bank) in the field of monetary policy and instruments for the implementation thereof, 
recognise the ECB’s powers in this field. 
6.5.1.2 Collection of statistics 
Article 3(8) and Article 52 of the Law on BNB, which provide for the powers of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) relating to the collection of 
statistics, recognise the ECB’s powers in this field. 
6.5.1.3 Official foreign reserve management 
Articles 39 to 42 of the Law on BNB, which provide for the powers of Българска 
народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) with regard to the management of official 
foreign reserves, recognise the ECB’s powers in this field. 
197  See paragraph 3.1.6 of Opinion CON/2015/46, paragraph 3.2.1 of Opinion CON/2016/19 and paragraph 
2.2 of Opinion CON/2016/57.

ECB-CONFIDENTIAL 
6.5.1.4 Payment systems 
Article 3(5) of the Law on BNB, which provides for the powers of Българска народна 
банка (Bulgarian National Bank) with regard to the promotion of the smooth operation 
of payment systems, recognises the ECB’s powers in this field. 
6.5.1.5 Issue of banknotes 
Article 3(2) and Articles 26 to 36 of the Law on BNB, which provide for the powers of 
Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) with regard to the issue of 
banknotes and coins, recognise the Council’s and the ECB’s powers in this field.199 
6.5.2 Financial provisions 
6.5.2.1 Appointment of independent auditors 
Article 7(7) of the Law on BNB, which provides that the external auditor is appointed by 
the Governing Council on the basis of a procedure complying with the Law on public 
procurement, recognises the Council’s and the ECB’s powers under Article 27.1 of the 
Statute of the ESCB. 
6.5.2.2 Financial reporting 
Articles 53 to 57 of the Law on BNB reflect the obligation to comply with the 
Eurosystem’s regime for financial reporting of NCB operations, pursuant to Article 26 
of the Statute of the ESCB. 
6.5.3 International cooperation 
Article 5(2) and Article 17, points 11 and 12, of the Law on BNB, which provide for the 
powers of Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) with regard to 
international cooperation, recognise the ECB’s powers in this field. 
6.6 Conclusions 
The Law on BNB has been amended to reflect and implement the recommendations 
made in the ECB’s Convergence Report of June 2024. As a result, the national 
legislation is compatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL
On 3 May 1998, the Council decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Austria and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions 
to adopt the euro on 1 January 1999. Denmark and the United Kingdom made use of their
optout clauses and were therefore not assessed by the Council. Greece and Sweden were 
considered by the Council as Member States with a derogation. 
On 19 June 2000, the Council decided that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt 
the euro on 1 January 2001. The countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 
(Czechia, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) 
became Member States with a derogation in accordance with Article 4 of the respective Act of 
Accession. 
On 11 July 2006, the Council decided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt 
the euro on 1 January 2007. 
Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007 and became Member 
States with a derogation in accordance with Article 5 of the respective Act of Accession. 
On 10 July 2007, the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions 
to adopt the euro on 1 January 2008. 
On 8 July 2008, the Council decided that Slovakia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt 
the euro on 1 January 2009. 
On 13 July 2010, the Council decided that Estonia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt 
the euro on 1 January 2011. 
On 9 July 2013, the Council decided that Latvia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt the 
euro on 1 January 2014. 
On 23 July 2014, the Council decided that Lithuania fulfilled the necessary conditions to 
adopt the euro on 1 January 2015. 
On 12 July 2022, the Council decided that Croatia fulfilled the necessary conditions to adopt 
the euro on 1 January 2023. 
Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘the TFEU’) states 
that at least once every two years or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the 
Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) have to report to the Council on the 
progress made by Member States with a derogation in fulfilling their obligations to achieve 
economic and monetary union. 
Based on its own report and that of the ECB, the Commission should submit to the Council a 
proposal for a Council decision, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 140(2) 
of the TFEU, to abrogate the derogation of the Member States fulfilling the necessary 
conditions. 
Both the Commission and the ECB convergence reports were released on 4 June 2025. The 
reports include an examination of the compatibility between Bulgaria’s national legislation, 
including the statutes of its national central bank, with Articles 130 and 131 of the TFEU and 
the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the ECB. 
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 152 –
EN 2 EN 
The reports also examine whether a high degree of sustainable convergence has been 
achieved, by referring the fulfilment of the convergence criteria, and take account of several 
other factors required under the final subparagraph of Article 140(1) of the TFEU. 
In its convergence report, the Commission concludes that Bulgaria fulfils the conditions for 
adopting the euro. 
In its convergence report, the ECB has not identified any obstacle to abrogating the 
derogation concerning Bulgaria.  
On the basis of its report and that of the ECB, the Commission has adopted the attached 
proposal for a Council decision to abrogate the derogation of Bulgaria, with effect from 
1 January 2026. 
2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Discussions with Member States on the economic policy challenges in Member States are 
regularly held under various headings in the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) and 
the ECOFIN/Eurogroup. These include informal discussions on issues specifically relevant to 
preparing for eventual entry in the euro area (including exchange rate policies). 
Economic developments in the euro area and the Member States are assessed through the 
various procedures of economic policy coordination and surveillance (specifically under 
Article 121 TFEU), and as part of the Commission’s regular monitoring and analysis of 
country-specific and area-wide developments (including forecasts, regular publication series, 
and input to the EFC and ECOFIN/Eurogroup). In line with the proportionality principle and 
with past practice, no formal impact assessment has been carried out. 
3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL
3.1. Legal basis
The legal basis for this proposal is Article 140(2) TFEU, which provides for the procedure for 
a Council decision on euro adoption and for abrogating the derogation in the Member States 
concerned. 
The Council shall act on a proposal from the Commission, after consulting the European 
Parliament, after discussion in the European Council and after having received a 
recommendation of a qualified majority of those among its members representing Member 
States whose currency is the euro. 
3.2. Subsidiarity and proportionality 
The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. Therefore, the subsidiarity 
principle does not apply. 
This initiative does not go beyond what is needed to achieve its objective and, therefore, 
complies with the proportionality principle. 
3.3. Choice of legal instrument 
In accordance with Article 140(2) TFEU, a decision is the appropriate legal instrument. 
4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION
The proposal has no implications for the budget of the Union.

16 June 1997 (17). The procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of
economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of

Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and with the Statute of the European System of Central 
Banks and of the European Central Bank (‘Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB’). The 
reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the 
compatibility of the legislation of Bulgaria with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and with 
the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB. 
(8) In accordance with Article 1 of Protocol No 13 on the convergence criteria annexed to
the TFEU, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of
Article 140(1) TFEU means that a Member State has a price performance that is
sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before
the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points
that of, at most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability.
For the purpose of the criterion on price stability, inflation is measured by the
harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/792
of the European Parliament and of the Council (19). To assess the price stability
criterion, a Member State’s inflation is measured by the percentage change in the
arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices, relative to the arithmetic average of 12
monthly indices from the previous period. A reference value calculated as the simple
arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best-performing Member States in
terms of price stability, plus 1.5 percentage points, was used in the reports of the
Commission and the ECB. In the one-year period ending in April 2025, the inflation
reference value was calculated to be 2.8%, with Ireland, Finland and Italy as the three
best-performing Member States in terms of price stability, with inflation rates of 1.2%,
1.3%, and 1.4%, respectively.
(9) In accordance with Article 2 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on the government
budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) TFEU requires
that, at the time of the examination, the Member State not be the subject of a Council
decision under Article 126(6) TFEU that an excessive deficit exists.
(10) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on participation in the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third
indent of Article 140(1) TFEU requires a Member State to have respected the normal
fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the
European Monetary System, without severe tensions, for at least the last two years
before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its
currency’s bilateral central rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same
period. Since 1 January 1999, the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the
fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in
their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending
on 19 May 2025.
(11) In accordance with Article 4 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on the convergence of
interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) TFEU means that,
observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an
average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two
percentage points that of, at most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of
price stability. The criterion used to assess the convergence of interest rates was
(19) Regulation (EU) 2016/792 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on
harmonised indices of consumer prices and the house price index, and repealing Council Regulation
(EC) No 2494/95 (OJ L 135, 24.5.2016, p. 11).
Drucksache 21/530 Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode– 156 –
EN 6 EN 
comparable interest rates on ten-year benchmark government bonds. To assess the 
fulfilment of the interest-rate criterion, a reference value calculated as the simple 
arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best-performing 
Member States in terms of price stability, plus two percentage points, was considered 
in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. The reference value is based on the 
long-term interest rates in Ireland (2.8%), Finland (2.9%) and Italy (3.7%), and in the 
12-month period ending in April 2025 it was 5.1%.
(12) In accordance with Article 5 of Protocol No 13, the data used in assessing the
fulfilment of the convergence criteria was provided by the Commission. Budgetary
data were provided by the Commission after reporting by the Member States before
1 April 2025, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (20).
(13) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress
made by Bulgaria in fulfilling its obligations regarding the achievement of economic
and monetary union, it is concluded that in Bulgaria, national legislation, including the
Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU
and with the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB.
(14) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress
made by Bulgaria in fulfilling its obligations regarding the achievement of economic
and monetary union, it is concluded that, regarding the fulfilment by Bulgaria of the
convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 140(1) TFEU: the
average inflation rate in Bulgaria in the 12-month period ending in April 2025 stood at
2.7%, which is below the reference value, and a review of a broad range of indicators
does not identify causes for concern regarding the sustainability of price stability;
Bulgaria is not the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive
deficit; Bulgaria has been a member of ERM II since 10 July 2020 and during the two
years preceding the assessment, the lev (BGN) exchange rate has not been subject to
severe tensions and Bulgaria has not devalued the BGN bilateral central rate against
the euro on its own initiative. Finally, in the 12-month period ending in April 2025, the
long-term interest rate in Bulgaria was, on average, 3.9%, which is well below the
reference value.
(15) In the light of the assessment on legal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the
convergence criteria as well as the assessment of additional factors, Bulgaria fulfils the
necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Bulgaria fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro. The derogation referred 
to in Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2026.

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL
On 4 June 2025, the Commission released a proposal for a Council Decision in
accordance with Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union (the TFEU). The proposal indicates that Bulgaria fulfils the necessary
conditions to adopt the euro and that the derogation of Bulgaria is abrogated with
effect from 1 January 2026.
In the event of a positive decision, the Council will subsequently have to take the
other measures needed for introducing the euro in Bulgaria.
Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro (1) governs the
initial introduction of the euro in the first-wave euro-area Member States and Greece
(2). That Regulation was amended by:
– Regulation (EC) No 2169/2005, to prepare for future enlargements of the euro area
– Regulation (EC) No 1647/2006, to cover Slovenia (which adopted the euro on
1 January 2007)
– Regulation (EC) No 835/2007, to cover Cyprus (which adopted the euro on
1 January 2008)
– Regulation (EC) No 836/2007, to cover Malta (which adopted the euro on
1 January 2008)
– Regulation (EC) No 693/2008, to cover Slovakia (which adopted the euro in
January 2009)
– Regulation (EU) No 670/2010, to cover Estonia (which adopted the euro in January
2011)
– Regulation (EU) No 678/2013, to cover Latvia (which adopted the euro in January
2014)
– Regulation (EU) No 827/2014, to cover Lithuania (which adopted the euro in
January 2015)
– Regulation (EU) No 2022/1207, to cover Croatia (which adopted the euro in
January 2023).
For Bulgaria to also be covered by Regulation (EC) No 974/98, a reference to this 
Member State needs to be added to that Regulation. This proposal contains the 
necessary amendments to that Regulation. 
Bulgaria’s National Euro Changeover Plan specifies that the adoption of the euro as 
the currency of Bulgaria should coincide with the introduction of euro banknotes and 
coins in Bulgaria.

2. RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Discussions with Member States on the economic policy challenges in Member
States are regularly held under various headings in the Economic and Financial
Committee (EFC) and the ECOFIN/Eurogroup. These include informal discussions
on issues specifically relevant to preparing for eventual entry into the euro area
(including exchange rate policies).
Economic developments in the euro area and the Member States are assessed through
the various procedures of economic policy coordination and surveillance
(specifically under Article 121 TFEU), and as part of the Commission’s regular
monitoring and analysis of country-specific and area-wide developments (including
forecasts, regular publication series, and input to the EFC and ECOFIN/Eurogroup).
In line with the proportionality principle and with past practice, no formal impact
assessment is needed.
3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL
3.1. Legal basis
The legal basis for this proposal is Article 140(3) TFEU, which allows for the
adoption of the other measures needed for introducing the euro in a Member State
whose derogation has been abrogated under Article 140(2) TFEU.
The Council shall act with the unanimity of those Member States whose currency is
the euro and the Member State concerned, on a proposal from the Commission and
after consulting the ECB.
3.2. Subsidiarity and proportionality
The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Union. Therefore, the
subsidiarity principle does not apply.
This initiative does not go beyond what is needed to achieve its objective and,
therefore, complies with the proportionality principle.
3.3. Choice of legal instrument
A Regulation is the appropriate legal instrument for amending Council Regulation
(EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro.
4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION
The proposal has no implications for the budget of the Union.
5. COMMENTARY ON INDIVIDUAL ARTICLES
5.1. Article 1
In accordance with Article 1 lit. (a) and with Article 1a of Regulation (EC) No
974/98, the table in the Annex to that Regulation lists the participating Member
States and defines the euro adoption date, the cash changeover date, and the
‘phasing-out’ period, if applicable, for all these Member States.
According to Article 1 lit. (i) of Regulation (EC) No 974/98, a ‘phasing-out’ period
can only apply to Member States where the euro adoption date and the cash
changeover date fall on the same day. This was neither the case for the eleven
Deutscher Bundestag – 21. Wahlperiode Drucksache 21/530– 161 –
EN 3 EN 
Member States that adopted the euro on 1 January 1999, nor for Greece, which 
adopted the euro on 1 January 2001. 
The dates for adopting the euro and the cash changeover coincided in Slovenia, 
Cyprus, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Croatia (1 January 2007 for 
Slovenia, 1 January 2008 for Cyprus and Malta, 1 January 2009 for Slovakia, 
1 January 2011 for Estonia, 1 January 2014 for Latvia, 1 January 2015 for Lithuania, 
1 January 2023 for Croatia). However, these countries chose not to have a ‘
phasingout’ period. 
Bulgaria’s National Euro Changeover Plan also sets the same date for the country's 
adoption of the euro and the cash changeover (1 January 2026), and Bulgaria chose 
not to have a ‘phasing-out’ period. 
This Article adds Bulgaria and the following relevant data for this Member State to 
the table in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 974/98 in protocol order. 
Member State Euro adoption date Cash changeover date Member State with a 
‘phasing-out’ period 
‘Bulgaria 1 January 2026 1 January 2026 No’ 
5.2. Article 2 
This Article sets the date of 1 January 2026 for the entry into force of the Regulation, 
ensuring that it will be applicable in conformity with the timing of the other Council acts 
related to Bulgaria's adoption of the euro, i.e. the same date when the derogation is abrogated 
and when the conversion rate for the Bulgarian lev enters into force.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular 
Article 140(3) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (3),

adoption of the euro at the time when the Community entered the third stage of
economic and monetary union.
(2) According to Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession (5), Bulgaria participates in
Economic and Monetary Union from the date of accession as Member State with a
derogation, within the meaning of Article 139(1) of the Treaty.
(3) Pursuant to Council Decision (EU) 2025/…. (6), Bulgaria fulfils the necessary 
conditions for the adoption of the euro and the derogation regarding Bulgaria is to be 
abrogated with effect from 1 January 2026. 
(4) The introduction of the euro in Bulgaria requires the extension to Bulgaria of the
existing provisions on the introduction of the euro that are set out in Regulation (EC)
No 974/98.
(5) Bulgaria National Euro Changeover Plan specifies that euro banknotes and coins
should become legal tender in that Member State on the day of the introduction of the
euro as its currency. Consequently, the euro adoption date and the cash changeover
date should be 1 January 2026. No ‘phasing-out’ period should apply.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 974/98 should therefore be amended accordingly,
